# This test case previously tested an overflow case ("2094 Nov 6 =>
# 2147483647") for 32-bit time_t, but since some systems have 64-bit time_t and
# handles this (returning 3939840000), and some 64-bit time_t systems don't
# handle this and return -1 for this, it turned very tricky to write a fine
# test case and thus it is now removed until we have a way to write test cases
# for this kind of things.
