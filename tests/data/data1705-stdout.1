.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcurl\fP is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs. It
supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS,
IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP,
SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.

curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer\-related features. See
\fIlibcurl(3)\fP for details.
.IP "\-v, \-\-fakeitreal"
Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for debugging and seeing
what\(aqs going on under the hood. A line starting with > means header data sent
by curl, < means header data received by curl that is hidden in normal cases,
and a line starting with * means additional info provided by curl.

If you only want HTTP headers in the output, \fI\-\-include\fP or \fI\-\-dump\-header\fP might
be more suitable options.

If you think this option still does not give you enough details, consider using
\fI\-\-trace\fP or \fI\-\-trace\-ascii\fP instead.

Note that verbose output of curl activities and network traffic might contain
sensitive data, including usernames, credentials or secret data content. Be
aware and be careful when sharing trace logs with others.

End with a quote

.nf
hello
.fi

This option is global and does not need to be specified for each use of \fI\-\-next\fP.

Providing \fI\-\-fakeitreal\fP multiple times has no extra effect.
Disable it again with \-\-no-fakeitreal.

Example:
.nf
curl --fakeitreal https://example.com
.fi

This option is mutually exclusive with \fI\-\-trace\fP and \fI\-\-trace\-ascii\fP.
See also \fI\-\-include\fP, \fI\-\-silent\fP, \fI\-\-trace\fP and \fI\-\-trace\-ascii\fP.
.IP "\-\-proto <protocols>"
Limit what protocols to allow for transfers. Protocols are evaluated left to
right, are comma separated, and are each a protocol name or \(aqall\(aq, optionally
prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:
.RS
.IP +
Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted (this is
the default if no modifier is used).
.IP -
Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already permitted.
.IP =
Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already permitted), though
subject to later modification by subsequent entries in the comma separated
list.
.RE
.IP
For example: \fI\-\-proto\fP \-ftps uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

\fI\-\-proto\fP \-all,https,+http only enables http and https

\fI\-\-proto\fP =http,https also only enables http and https

Unknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to
safely rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without
relying upon support for that protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.

This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the same
as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the option.

If \fI\-\-proto\fP is provided several times, the last set value is used.

Example:
.nf
curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com
.fi

See also \fI\-\-fakeitreal\fP and \fI\-\-proto\-default\fP.
.SH PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
alternative proxy protocols.

If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string does not
match a supported one, the proxy is treated as an HTTP proxy.

The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:
.IP http://
Makes it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme prefix is used.
.IP https://
Makes it treated as an \fBHTTPS\fP proxy.
.IP socks4://
Makes it the equivalent of \fI\-\-socks4\fP
.IP socks4a://
Makes it the equivalent of \fI\-\-socks4a\fP
.IP socks5://
Makes it the equivalent of \fI\-\-socks5\fP
.IP socks5h://
Makes it the equivalent of \fI\-\-socks5\-hostname\fP
