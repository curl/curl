# DESCRIPTION

**curl** is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs. It
supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS,
IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP,
SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.

curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See
*libcurl(3)* for details.

# `--verbose`

Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for debugging and seeing
what's going on under the hood. A line starting with \> means header data sent
by curl, \< means header data received by curl that is hidden in normal cases,
and a line starting with * means additional info provided by curl.

If you only want HTTP headers in the output, --include or --dump-header might
be more suitable options.

If you think this option still does not give you enough details, consider using
--trace or --trace-ascii instead.

Note that verbose output of curl activities and network traffic might contain
sensitive data, including usernames, credentials or secret data content. Be
aware and be careful when sharing trace logs with others.

# `--proto`

Limit what protocols to allow for transfers. Protocols are evaluated left to
right, are comma separated, and are each a protocol name or 'all', optionally
prefixed by zero or more modifiers. Available modifiers are:

## +
Permit this protocol in addition to protocols already permitted (this is
the default if no modifier is used).

## -
Deny this protocol, removing it from the list of protocols already permitted.

## =
Permit only this protocol (ignoring the list already permitted), though
subject to later modification by subsequent entries in the comma separated
list.

##

For example: --proto -ftps uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

--proto -all,https,+http only enables http and https

--proto =http,https also only enables http and https

Unknown and disabled protocols produce a warning. This allows scripts to
safely rely on being able to disable potentially dangerous protocols, without
relying upon support for that protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.

This option can be used multiple times, in which case the effect is the same
as concatenating the protocols into one instance of the option.

# PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES
The proxy string may be specified with a protocol:// prefix to specify
alternative proxy protocols. (Added in 7.21.7)

If no protocol is specified in the proxy string or if the string does not
match a supported one, the proxy is treated as an HTTP proxy.

The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:
## http://
Makes it use it as an HTTP proxy. The default if no scheme prefix is used.
## https://
Makes it treated as an **HTTPS** proxy.
## socks4://
Makes it the equivalent of --socks4
## socks4a://
Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a
## socks5://
Makes it the equivalent of --socks5
## socks5h://
Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname

DESCRIPTION

    curl is a tool  for transferring data  from or to a  server using URLs.  It
    supports these protocols:  DICT, FILE,  FTP, FTPS,  GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,
    HTTPS, IMAP,  IMAPS, LDAP,  LDAPS, MQTT,  POP3, POP3S,  RTMP, RTMPS,  RTSP,
    SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.

    curl  is  powered  by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.   See
    libcurl(3) for details.

    -v, --fakeitreal
	    Makes curl verbose during the  operation. Useful for debugging  and
	    seeing what's  going on  under the  hood. A  line  starting with  >
	    means header data  sent by curl,  < means  header data received  by
	    curl that is  hidden in normal  cases, and a  line starting with  *
	    means additional info provided by curl.

	    If  you  only  want  HTTP  headers  in  the  output,  --include  or
	    --dump-header might be more suitable options.

	    If you think this  option still does  not give you enough  details,
	    consider using --trace or --trace-ascii instead.

	    Note that verbose  output of  curl activities  and network  traffic
	    might contain sensitive data,  including usernames, credentials  or
	    secret data content.  Be aware  and be careful  when sharing  trace
	    logs with others.

	    This option is global  and does not need  to be specified for  each
	    use of --next. Providing --fakeitreal  multiple times has no  extra
	    effect. Disable it again with --no-fakeitreal.

	    Example:
	     curl --verbose https://example.com

	    This option is mutually  exclusive with --trace and  --trace-ascii.
	    See also --include, --silent, --trace and --trace-ascii.

    --proto <protocols>
	    Limit  what  protocols  to  allow  for  transfers.  Protocols   are
	    evaluated left  to  right, are  comma  separated, and  are  each  a
	    protocol name  or  'all',  optionally  prefixed  by  zero  or  more
	    modifiers. Available modifiers are:

	    +

		Permit  this  protocol   in  addition   to  protocols   already
		permitted (this is the default if no modifier is used).

	    -

		Deny this  protocol, removing  it from  the list  of  protocols
		already permitted.

	    =

		Permit  only   this  protocol   (ignoring  the   list   already
		permitted), though subject to later modification by  subsequent
		entries in  the  comma  separated list.  For  example:  --proto
		-ftps uses the default protocols, but disables ftps

		--proto -all,https,+http only enables http and https

		--proto =http,https also only enables http and https

		Unknown and disabled protocols  produce a warning. This  allows
		scripts to safely  rely on  being able  to disable  potentially
		dangerous protocols,  without  relying upon  support  for  that
		protocol being built into curl to avoid an error.

		This option  can be  used  multiple times,  in which  case  the
		effect is  the same  as concatenating  the protocols  into  one
		instance of the option.

	    If --proto is provided several times, the last set value is used.

	    Example:
	     curl --proto =http,https,sftp https://example.com

	    See also --fakeitreal and --proto-default.

PROXY PROTOCOL PREFIXES

    The proxy  string may be  specified with  a protocol://  prefix to  specify
    alternative proxy protocols.

    If no protocol is specified in the  proxy string or if the string does  not
    match a supported one, the proxy is treated as an HTTP proxy.

    The supported proxy protocol prefixes are as follows:

    http://

	Makes it use it as  an HTTP proxy. The  default if no scheme prefix  is
	used.

    https://

	Makes it treated as an HTTPS proxy.

    socks4://

	Makes it the equivalent of --socks4

    socks4a://

	Makes it the equivalent of --socks4a

    socks5://

	Makes it the equivalent of --socks5

    socks5h://

	Makes it the equivalent of --socks5-hostname
