# This test is quite timing dependent and tricky to set up. The time line of
# test operations looks like this:
#
# 1. curl sends a PUT request with Expect: 100-continue and waits only 1 msec
#    for a 100 response.
# 2. The HTTP server accepts the connection but waits 500 msec before acting
#    on the request.
# 3. curl doesn't receive the expected 100 response before its timeout expires,
#    so it starts sending the body. It is throttled by a --limit-rate, so it
#    sends the first 64 KiB then stops for 1000 msec due to this
#    throttling.
# 4. The server sends its 417 response while curl is throttled.
# 5. curl responds to this 417 response by closing the connection (because it
#    has a half-completed response outstanding) and starting a new one. This
#    new request does not have an Expect: header so it is sent without delay.
#    It's still throttled, however, so it takes about 16 seconds to finish
#    sending.
# 6. The server receives the response and this time acks it with 200.
#
# Because of the timing sensitivity (scheduling delays of 500 msec can cause
# the test to fail), this test is marked flaky to avoid it being run in the CI
# builds which are often run on overloaded servers.
# Increasing the --limit-rate would decrease the test time, but at the cost of
# becoming even more sensitive to delays (going from 500 msec to 250 msec or
# less of accepted delay before failure).
