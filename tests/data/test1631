# This is the FTP server response. The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe
<data>
I was born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good family, though not
of that country, myfather being a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at
Hull.  He got a good estate by merchandise,and leaving off his trade, lived
afterwards at York, from whence he had married my mother, whoserelations were
named Robinson, a very good family in that country, and from whom I was
calledRobinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of words in England,
we are now called—nay wecall ourselves and write our name—Crusoe; and so my
companions always called me.
