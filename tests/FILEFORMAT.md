# curl test suite file format

The curl test suite's file format is simple and extendable, closely resembling
XML. All data for a single test case resides in a single ASCII file. Labels
mark the beginning and the end of all sections, and each label must be written
in its own line. Comments are either XML-style (enclosed with `<!--` and
`-->`) or shell script style (beginning with `#`) and must appear on their own
lines and not alongside actual test data. Most test data files are
syntactically valid XML, although a few files are not (lack of support for
character entities and the preservation of CR/LF characters at the end of
lines are the biggest differences).

Each test case source exists as a file matching the format
`tests/data/testNUM`, where `NUM` is the unique test number, and must begin
with a `testcase` tag, which encompasses the remainder of the file.

# Preprocessing

When a test is to be executed, the source file is first preprocessed and
variables are substituted by their respective contents and the output version
of the test file is stored as `%LOGDIR/testNUM`. That version is what is read
and used by the test servers.

## Base64 Encoding

In the preprocess stage, a special instruction can be used to have runtests.pl
base64 encode a certain section and insert in the generated output file. This
is in particular good for test cases where the test tool is expected to pass
in base64 encoded content that might use dynamic information that is unique
for this particular test invocation, like the server port number.

To insert a base64 encoded string into the output, use this syntax:

    %b64[ data to encode ]b64%

The data to encode can then use any of the existing variables mentioned below,
or even percent-encoded individual bytes. As an example, insert the HTTP
server's port number (in ASCII) followed by a space and the hexadecimal byte
9a:

    %b64[%HTTPPORT %9a]b64%

## Hexadecimal decoding

In the preprocess stage, a special instruction can be used to have runtests.pl
generate a sequence of binary bytes.

To insert a sequence of bytes from a hex encoded string, use this syntax:

    %hex[ %XX-encoded data to decode ]hex%

For example, to insert the binary octets 0, 1 and 255 into the test file:

    %hex[ %00%01%FF ]hex%

## Repeat content

In the preprocess stage, a special instruction can be used to have runtests.pl
generate a repetitive sequence of bytes.

To insert a sequence of repeat bytes, use this syntax to make the `<string>`
get repeated `<number>` of times. The number has to be 1 or larger and the
string may contain `%HH` hexadecimal codes:

    %repeat[<number> x <string>]%

For example, to insert the word hello 100 times:

    %repeat[100 x hello]%

## Insert capped epoch days

Mostly to test capped cookie expire dates: `%days[NUM]` inserts the number of
seconds for the given number of days into the future, aligned to the nearest
minute. That is the same calculation the cookie engine uses to cap expiration
dates.

## Include file

This instruction allows a test case to include another file. It is helpful to
remember that the ordinary variables are expanded before the include happens
so `%LOGDIR` and the others can be used in the include line.

The filename cannot contain `%` as that letter is used to end the name for
the include instruction:

    %include filename%

## Conditional lines

Lines in the test file can be made to appear conditionally on a specific
feature (see the "features" section below) being set or not set. If the
specific feature is present, the following lines are output, otherwise it
outputs nothing, until a following else or `endif` clause. Like this:

    %if brotli
    Accept-Encoding
    %endif

It can also check for the inverse condition, so if the feature is *not* set by
the use of an exclamation mark:

    %if !brotli
    Accept-Encoding: not-brotli
    %endif

You can also make an "else" clause to get output for the opposite condition,
like:

    %if brotli
    Accept-Encoding: brotli
    %else
    Accept-Encoding: nothing
    %endif

Nested conditions are supported.

# Variables

replaced by their content at that time.

Available substitute variables include:

# `<testcase>`

Each test is always specified entirely within the `testcase` tag. Each test
case is split up in four main sections: `info`, `reply`, `client` and
`verify`.

- **info** provides information about the test case

- **reply** is used for the server to know what to send as a reply for the
requests curl sends

- **client** defines how the client should behave

- **verify** defines how to verify that the data stored after a command has
been run ended up correct

Each main section has a number of available subsections that can be specified,
that are checked/used if specified.

## `<info>`

### `<keywords>`
A newline-separated list of keywords describing what this test case uses and
tests. Try to use already used keywords. These keywords are used for
statistical/informational purposes and for choosing or skipping classes of
tests. Keywords must begin with an alphabetic character, `-`, `[` or `{` and
may actually consist of multiple words separated by spaces which are treated
together as a single identifier. Most keywords are only there to provide a way
for users to skip certain classes of tests, if desired, but a few are treated
specially by the test harness or build system.

When running a unit test and the keywords include `unittest`, the `<tool>`
section can be left empty to use the standard unit test tool name `unitN` where
`N` is the test number.

The `text-ci` make target automatically skips test with the `flaky` keyword.

Tests that have strict timing dependencies have the `timing-dependent` keyword.
These are intended to eventually be treated specially on CI builds which are
often run on overloaded machines with unpredictable timing.

## `<reply>`

### `<data [nocheck="yes"] [sendzero="yes"] [base64="yes"] [hex="yes"] [nonewline="yes"] [crlf="yes"]>`

data to be sent to the client on its request and later verified that it
arrived safely. Set `nocheck="yes"` to prevent the test script from verifying
the arrival of this data.

If the data contains `swsclose` anywhere within the start and end tag, and
this is an HTTP test, then the connection is closed by the server after this
response is sent. If not, the connection is kept persistent.

If the data contains `swsbounce` anywhere within the start and end tag, then
the HTTP server overrides the part number response returned for a subsequent
request made by the same test to `previous part number + 1`. For example, if a
test makes a request which causes the server to return `<data>` that contains
keyword `swsbounce` then for the next response it ignores the requested part
number and instead returns `<data1>`. And if `<data1>` contains keyword
`swsbounce` then the next response is `<data2>` and so on. This is useful for
auth tests and similar.

`sendzero=yes` means that the (FTP) server "sends" the data even if the size
is zero bytes. Used to verify curl's behavior on zero bytes transfers.

`base64=yes` means that the data provided in the test-file is a chunk of data
encoded with base64. It is the only way a test case can contain binary
data. (This attribute can in fact be used on any section, but it does not make
much sense for other sections than "data").

`hex=yes` means that the data is a sequence of hex pairs. It gets decoded and
used as "raw" data.

`nonewline=yes` means that the last byte (the trailing newline character)
should be cut off from the data before sending or comparing it.

`crlf=yes` forces *header* newlines to become CRLF even if not written so in
the source file. Note that this makes runtests.pl parse and "guess" what is a
header and what is not in order to apply the CRLF line endings appropriately.

For FTP file listings, the `<data>` section is be used *only* if you make sure
that there has been a CWD done first to a directory named `test-[NUM]` where
`NUM` is the test case number. Otherwise the ftp server cannot know from which
test file to load the list content.

### `<dataNUM [crlf="yes"]>`

Send back this contents instead of the `<data>` one. The `NUM` is set by:

 - The test number in the request line is >10000 and this is the remainder
   of [test case number]%10000.
 - The request was HTTP and included digest details, which adds 1000 to `NUM`
 - If an HTTP request is NTLM type-1, it adds 1001 to `NUM`
 - If an HTTP request is NTLM type-3, it adds 1002 to `NUM`
 - If an HTTP request is Basic and `NUM` is already >=1000, it adds 1 to `NUM`
 - If an HTTP request is Negotiate, `NUM` gets incremented by one for each
   request with Negotiate authorization header on the same test case.

Dynamically changing `NUM` in this way allows the test harness to be used to
test authentication negotiation where several different requests must be sent
to complete a transfer. The response to each request is found in its own data
section. Validating the entire negotiation sequence can be done by specifying
a `datacheck` section.

### `<connect>`
The connect section is used instead of the 'data' for all CONNECT
requests. The remainder of the rules for the data section then apply but with
a connect prefix.

### `<socks>`
Address type and address details as logged by the SOCKS proxy.

### `<datacheck [mode="text"] [nonewline="yes"] [crlf="yes"]>`
if the data is sent but this is what should be checked afterwards. If
`nonewline=yes` is set, runtests cuts off the trailing newline from the data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client.

Use the `mode="text"` attribute if the output is in text mode on platforms
that have a text/binary difference.

### `<datacheckNUM [nonewline="yes"] [mode="text"] [crlf="yes"]>`
The contents of numbered `datacheck` sections are appended to the non-numbered
one.

### `<size>`
number to return on an ftp SIZE command (set to -1 to make this command fail)

### `<mdtm>`
what to send back if the client sends a (FTP) `MDTM` command, set to -1 to
have it return that the file does not exist

### `<postcmd>`
special purpose server-command to control its behavior *after* the
reply is sent
For HTTP/HTTPS, these are supported:

`wait [secs]` - Pause for the given time

### `<servercmd>`
Special-commands for the server.

The first line of this file is always set to `Testnum [number]` by the test
script, to allow servers to read that to know what test the client is about to
issue.

#### For FTP/SMTP/POP/IMAP

- `REPLY [command] [return value] [response string]` - Changes how the server
  responds to the [command]. [response string] is evaluated as a perl string,
  so it can contain embedded \r\n, for example. There is a special [command]
  named "welcome" (without quotes) which is the string sent immediately on
  connect as a welcome.
- `REPLYLF` (like above but sends the response terminated with LF-only and not
   CRLF)
- `COUNT [command] [num]` - Do the `REPLY` change for `[command]` only `[num]`
  times and then go back to the built-in approach
- `DELAY [command] [secs]` - Delay responding to this command for the given
  time
- `RETRWEIRDO` - Enable the "weirdo" RETR case when multiple response lines
   appear at once when a file is transferred
- `RETRNOSIZE` - Make sure the RETR response does not contain the size of the
  file
- `RETRSIZE [size]` - Force RETR response to contain the specified size
- `NOSAVE` - Do not actually save what is received
- `SLOWDOWN` - Send FTP responses with 0.01 sec delay between each byte
- `SLOWDOWNDATA` - Send FTP responses with 0.01 sec delay between each data
  byte
- `PASVBADIP` - makes PASV send back an illegal IP in its 227 response
- `CAPA [capabilities]` - Enables support for and specifies a list of space
   separated capabilities to return to the client for the IMAP `CAPABILITY`,
   POP3 `CAPA` and SMTP `EHLO` commands
- `AUTH [mechanisms]` - Enables support for SASL authentication and specifies
   a list of space separated mechanisms for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP
- `STOR [msg]` respond with this instead of default after `STOR`

#### For HTTP/HTTPS

- `auth_required` if this is set and a POST/PUT is made without auth, the
  server does NOT wait for the full request body to get sent
- `delay: [msecs]` - delay this amount after connection
- `idle` - do nothing after receiving the request, just "sit idle"
- `stream` - continuously send data to the client, never-ending
- `writedelay: [msecs]` delay this amount between reply packets
- `skip: [num]` - instructs the server to ignore reading this many bytes from
  a PUT or POST request
- `rtp: part [num] channel [num] size [num]` - stream a fake RTP packet for
  the given part on a chosen channel with the given payload size
- `connection-monitor` - When used, this logs `[DISCONNECT]` to the
  `server.input` log when the connection is disconnected.
- `upgrade` - when an HTTP upgrade header is found, the server upgrades to
  http2
- `swsclose` - instruct server to close connection after response
- `no-expect` - do not read the request body if Expect: is present

#### For TFTP
`writedelay: [secs]` delay this amount between reply packets (each packet
  being 512 bytes payload)

## `<client>`

### `<server>`
What server(s) this test case requires/uses. Available servers:

- `dict`

Give only one per line. This subsection is mandatory (use `none` if no servers
are required). Servers that require a special server certificate can have the
PEM certificate filename (found in the `certs` directory) appended to the
server name separated by a space.

### `<features>`
A list of features that MUST be present in the client/library for this test to
be able to run. If a required feature is not present then the test is SKIPPED.

Alternatively a feature can be prefixed with an exclamation mark to indicate a
feature is NOT required. If the feature is present then the test is SKIPPED.

as well as each protocol that curl supports. A protocol only needs to be
specified if it is different from the server (useful when the server is
`none`).

### `<killserver>`
Using the same syntax as in `<server>` but when mentioned here these servers
are explicitly KILLED when this test case is completed. Only use this if there
is no other alternatives. Using this of course requires subsequent tests to
restart servers.

### `<precheck>`
A command line that if set gets run by the test script before the test. If an
output is displayed by the command or if the return code is non-zero, the test
is skipped and the (single-line) output is displayed as reason for not running
the test.

### `<tool>`
Name of tool to invoke instead of "curl". This tool must be built and exist
either in the `libtest/` directory (if the tool name starts with `lib`) or in
the `unit/` directory (if the tool name starts with `unit`).

### `<name>`
Brief test case description, shown when the test runs.

### `<setenv>`

    variable1=contents1
    variable2=contents2
    variable3

Set the given environment variables to the specified value before the actual
command is run. They are restored back to their former values again after the
command has been run.

If the variable name has no assignment, no `=`, then that variable is just
deleted.

### `<command [option="no-q/no-output/no-include/force-output/binary-trace"] [timeout="secs"][delay="secs"][type="perl/shell"]>`
Command line to run.

Note that the URL that gets passed to the server actually controls what data
that is returned. The last slash in the URL must be followed by a number. That
number (N) is used by the test-server to load test case N and return the data
that is defined within the `<reply><data></data></reply>` section.

If there is no test number found above, the HTTP test server uses the number
following the last dot in the given hostname (made so that a CONNECT can still
pass on test number) so that "foo.bar.123" gets treated as test case
123. Alternatively, if an IPv6 address is provided to CONNECT, the last
hexadecimal group in the address is used as the test number. For example the
address "[1234::ff]" would be treated as test case 255.

Set `type="perl"` to write the test case as a perl script. It implies that
there is no memory debugging and valgrind gets shut off for this test.

Set `type="shell"` to write the test case as a shell script. It implies that
there is no memory debugging and valgrind gets shut off for this test.

Set `option="no-output"` to prevent the test script to slap on the `--output`
argument that directs the output to a file. The `--output` is also not added
if the verify/stdout section is used.

Set `option="force-output"` to make use of `--output` even when the test is
otherwise written to verify stdout.

Set `option="no-include"` to prevent the test script to slap on the
`--include` argument.

Set `option="no-q"` avoid using `-q` as the first argument in the curl command
line.

Set `option="binary-trace"` to use `--trace` instead of `--trace-ascii` for
tracing. Suitable for binary-oriented protocols such as MQTT.

Set `timeout="secs"` to override default server logs advisor read lock
timeout. This timeout is used by the test harness, once that the command has
completed execution, to wait for the test server to write out server side log
files and remove the lock that advised not to read them. The "secs" parameter
is the not negative integer number of seconds for the timeout. This `timeout`
attribute is documented for completeness sake, but is deep test harness stuff
and only needed for singular and specific test cases. Avoid using it.

Set `delay="secs"` to introduce a time delay once that the command has
completed execution and before the `<postcheck>` section runs. The "secs"
parameter is the not negative integer number of seconds for the delay. This
'delay' attribute is intended for specific test cases, and normally not
needed.

### `<file name="%LOGDIR/filename" [nonewline="yes"]>`
This creates the named file with this content before the test case is run,
which is useful if the test case needs a file to act on.

If `nonewline="yes"` is used, the created file gets the final newline stripped
off.

### `<file1>`
1 to 4 can be appended to 'file' to create more files.

### `<file2>`

### `<file3>`

### `<file4>`

### `<stdin [nonewline="yes"]>`
Pass this given data on stdin to the tool.

If `nonewline` is set, we cut off the trailing newline of this given data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client

## `<disable>`

If `test-duphandle` is a listed item here, this is not run when
`--test-duphandle` is used.

## `<verify>`
### `<errorcode>`
numerical error code curl is supposed to return. Specify a list of accepted
error codes by separating multiple numbers with comma. See test 237 for an
example.

### `<strip>`
One regex per line that is removed from the protocol dumps before the
comparison is made. This is useful to remove dependencies on dynamically
changing protocol data such as port numbers or user-agent strings.

### `<strippart>`
One perl op per line that operates on the protocol dump. This is pretty
advanced. Example: `s/^EPRT .*/EPRT stripped/`.

### `<postcheck>`
A command line that if set gets run by the test script after the test. If the
command exists with a non-zero status code, the test is considered failed.

### `<notexists>`
A list of directory entries that are checked for after the test has completed
and that must not exist. A listed entry existing causes the test to fail.

### `<protocol [nonewline="yes"][crlf="yes"]>`

the protocol dump curl should transmit, if `nonewline` is set, we cut off the
trailing newline of this given data before comparing with the one actually
sent by the client The `<strip>` and `<strippart>` rules are applied before
comparisons are made.

`crlf=yes` forces the newlines to become CRLF even if not written so in the
test.

### `<proxy [nonewline="yes"][crlf="yes"]>`

The protocol dump curl should transmit to an HTTP proxy (when the http-proxy
server is used), if `nonewline` is set, we cut off the trailing newline of
this given data before comparing with the one actually sent by the client The
`<strip>` and `<strippart>` rules are applied before comparisons are made.

### `<stderr [mode="text"] [nonewline="yes"] [crlf="yes"]>`
This verifies that this data was passed to stderr.

Use the mode="text" attribute if the output is in text mode on platforms that
have a text/binary difference.

`crlf=yes` forces the newlines to become CRLF even if not written so in the
test.

If `nonewline` is set, we cut off the trailing newline of this given data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client

### `<stdout [mode="text"] [nonewline="yes"] [crlf="yes"] [loadfile="filename"]>`
This verifies that this data was passed to stdout.

Use the mode="text" attribute if the output is in text mode on platforms that
have a text/binary difference.

If `nonewline` is set, we cut off the trailing newline of this given data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client

`crlf=yes` forces the newlines to become CRLF even if not written so in the
test.

`loadfile="filename"` makes loading the data from an external file.

### `<file name="%LOGDIR/filename" [mode="text"]>`
The file's contents must be identical to this after the test is complete. Use
the mode="text" attribute if the output is in text mode on platforms that have
a text/binary difference.

### `<file1>`
1 to 4 can be appended to 'file' to compare more files.

### `<file2>`

### `<file3>`

### `<file4>`

### `<stripfile>`
One perl op per line that operates on the output file or stdout before being
compared with what is stored in the test file. This is pretty
advanced. Example: "s/^EPRT .*/EPRT stripped/"

### `<stripfile1>`
1 to 4 can be appended to `stripfile` to strip the corresponding `<fileN>`
content

### `<stripfile2>`

### `<stripfile3>`

### `<stripfile4>`

### `<upload [crlf="yes"] [nonewline="yes"]>`
the contents of the upload data curl should have sent

`crlf=yes` forces *upload* newlines to become CRLF even if not written so in
the source file.

`nonewline=yes` means that the last byte (the trailing newline character)
should be cut off from the upload data before comparing it.

### `<valgrind>`
disable - disables the valgrind log check for this test
