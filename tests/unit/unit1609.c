/* CURLOPT_RESOLVE address parsing test - to test the following defect fix:

 1) if there is already existing host:port pair in the DNS cache and
 we call CURLOPT_RESOLVE, it should also replace addresses.
 for example, if there is "test.com:80" with address "1.1.1.1"
 and we called CURLOPT_RESOLVE with address "2.2.2.2", then DNS entry needs to
 reflect that.

 2) when cached address is already there and close to expire, then by the
 time request is made, it can get expired.  This happens because, when
 we set address using CURLOPT_RESOLVE,
 it usually marks as permanent (by setting timestamp to zero). However,
 if address already exists
in the cache, then it does not mark it, but just leaves it as it is.
 So we fixing this by timestamp to zero if address already exists too.

Test:

 - insert new entry
 - verify that timestamp is not zero
 - call set options with CURLOPT_RESOLVE
 - then, call Curl_loadhostpairs

 expected result: cached address has zero timestamp.

 - call set options with CURLOPT_RESOLVE with same host:port pair,
   different address.
 - then, call Curl_loadhostpairs

 expected result: cached address has zero timestamp and new address
