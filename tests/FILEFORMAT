 The file format of the test suite is a very simple and extendable format. All
data for a single test case resides in a single ASCII file. Labels mark the
beginning and the end of all sections. Each label must be written in its own
line and is resembling XML/HTML.

 Each file is split up in three main sections: reply, client and verify. The
reply section is used for the server to know what to send as a reply for the
requests curl sends, the client section defines how the client should behave
while the verify section defines how to verify that the data stored after a
command has been run ended up correctly.

 Each main section has a number of available subsections that can be
specified, that will be checked/used if specified. This document includes all
the subsections currently supported.

<reply>
<data [nocheck=1]>
data to sent to the client on its request and later verified that it arrived
safely. Set the nocheck=1 to prevent the test script to verify the arrival
of this data.
</data>
<datacheck [nonewline=yes]>
if the data is sent but this is what should be checked afterwards. If
'nonewline' is set, we will cut off the trailing newline of this given data
before comparing with the one actually received by the client
</datacheck>
<size>
number to return on a ftp SIZE command
</size>
<cmd>
special purpose server-command to control its behavior *before* the
reply is sent
</cmd>
<postcmd>
special purpose server-command to control its behavior *after* the
reply is sent
</postcmd>
</reply>

<client>
<name>
test case description
</name>
<command [option=no-output]>
command line to run, there's a bunch of %variables that get replaced
accordingly. more about them elsewhere

Set 'option=no-output' to prevent the test script to slap on the --output
argument that directs the output to a file. The --output is also not added if
the client/stdout section is used.
</command>
<file name="log/filename">
this creates the named file with this content before the test case is run
which is useful if the test case needs a file to act on.
</file>
</client>

<verify>
<errorcode>
numerical error code curl is supposed to return
</errorcode>
<strip>
One regex per line that is removed from the protocol dumps before the
comparison is made. This is very useful to remove dependencies on dynamicly
changing protocol data such as port numbers or user-agent strings.
</strip>
<protocol [nonewline=yes]>
the protocol dump curl should transmit, if 'nonewline' is set, we will cut
off the trailing newline of this given data before comparing with the one
actually sent by the client
</protocol>
<stdout>
This verfies that this data was passed to stdout.
</stdout>
<file name="log/filename">
the file's contents must be identical to this
</file>
<upload>
the contents of the upload data curl should have sent
</upload>
</verify>
