/*
 * This code sets up multiple easy handles that transfer a single file from
 * the same URL, in a serial manner after each other. Due to the connection
 * sharing within the multi handle all transfers are performed on the same
 * persistent connection.
 *
 * This source code is used for test526, test527 and test532 with branches
 * controlling the small differences.
 *
 * - test526 closes all easy handles after
 *   they all have transferred the file over the single connection
 * - test527 closes each easy handle after each single transfer.
 * - test532 uses only a single easy handle that is removed, reset and then
 *   re-added for each transfer
 *
 * Test case 526, 527 and 532 use FTP, while test 528 uses the lib526 tool but
 * with HTTP.
