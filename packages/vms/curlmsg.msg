!
! These VMS error codes are generated by taking apart the curl.h
! file and putting all the CURLE_* enum stuff into this file,
! CURLMSG.MSG.  An .SDL file is created from this file with
! MESSAGE/SDL.  The .H file is created using the freeware SDL tool
! against the .SDL file with SDL/ALPHA/LANG=CC command.
!
! With the exception of CURLE_OK, all of the messages are at
! the error severity level.  With the exception of
! PEER_FAILED_VERIF, which is a shortened form of
! PEER_FAILED_VERIFICATION, these are the same names as the
! CURLE_ ones in include/curl.h.  The Message Utility manual states
! "The combined length of the prefix and the message symbol name cannot
! exceed 31 characters."  With a prefix of five that leaves us with 26
! for the message name.
!
! If you update this file also update curlmsg_vms.h so that they are in sync
!
