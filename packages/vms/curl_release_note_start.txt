From file: CURL_RELEASE_NOTE_START.TXT

Note: These kits are produced by a hobbyist and are providing any support
or any commitment to supply bug fixes or future releases.  This code is
as-is with no warranties.

The testing of this build of curl was minimal and involved building some of
the sample and test programs, accessing a public HTTPS: website, doing a
form post of some VMS test files, and FTP upload of some text files.

Due to the way that PCSI identifies packages, if you install a package from
one producer and then want to upgrade it from another producer, you will
probably need to uninstall the previous package first.

OpenVMS specific building and kitting instructions are after the standard
curl readme file.

This product may be available for your platform in a PCSI kit.  The source kit
contains files for building CURL using GNV or with a DCL procedure.

The GNV based build creates a libcurl share imaged which is supplied in the
PCSI kit.

This version of CURL will return VMS compatible status codes when run from
DCL and Unix compatible exit codes and messages when run with the SHELL
environment variable set.

This port of Curl uses the OpenSSL, Ldap, and Kerberos V5 that are bundled
with OpenVMS or supplied as updates by HP.  Ldap and Kerberos are not available
on the VAX platform.  See section below for a special note about HP OpenSSL
on Alpha and IA64.

The supplied CURL_STARTUP.COM procedure that is installed in
[VMS$COMMON.SYS$STARTUP] can be put in your VMS startup procedure to install
the GNV$LIBCURL shared image and create logical names GNV$LIBCURL to reference
it.  It will create the GNV$CURL_INCLUDE logical name for build procedures
to access the header files.

Normally to use curl from DCL, just create a foreign command as:
   curl :== $gnv$gnu:[usr.bin]gnv$curl.exe

If you need to work around having the older HP SSL kit installed, then
for DCL create this command procedure:

 $ create/dir gnv$gnu:[vms_bin]/prot=w:re
 $ create gnv$gnu:[vms_bin]curl.com
 $ curl := $gnv$gnu:[usr.bin]gnv$curl.exe
 $ define/user ssl$libcrypto_shr32 gnv$curl_ssl_libcryptoshr32
 $ curl "''p1'" "''p2'" "''p3'" "''p4'" "''p5'" "''p6'" "''p7'" "''p8'"
 ^Z

Then you can use: curl :== @gnv$gnu:[vms_bin]curl.com to run curl.

For the HP SSL work around to work for GNV do the following:
 $ create/dir gnv$gnu:[usr.local.bin]/prot=w:re
 $ create gnv$gnu:[usr.local.bin]curl.
 #! /bin/sh
 dcl @gnv\$gnu:[vms_bin]curl.com $*
 ^Z

Similar workarounds will be needed for any program linked with GNV$LIBCURL
until the HP OpenSSL is upgraded to the current 1.4 version or later.

If you are installing a "daily" build instead of a release build of Curl, some
things have been changed so that it can be installed at the same time as
a production build without conflicts.

   The CURL_DAILY_STARTUP.COM will be supplied instead of CURL_STARTUP.COM.
   This file is actually not used with the daily package and is provided as
   a preview of what the next CURL_STARTUP.COM will be for the next release.
   Do not run it.

   The files that are normally installed in [VMS$COMMON.GNV.usr], for the
   daily build are installed in [VMS$COMMON.GNV.beta] directory.

   To use the daily GNV$LIBCURL image, you will need to define the logical
   name GNV$LIBCURL to the image.
