  Changelog for the c-ares project

* May 11
- Nico Stappenbelt reported that when processing domain and search lines in
  the resolv.conf file, the first entry encountered is processed and used as
  the search list. According to the manual pages for both Linux, Solaris and
  Tru64, the last entry of either a domain or a search field is used.

  This is now adjusted in the code

Version 1.2.0 (April 13, 2004)

* April 2, 2004
- Updated various man pages to look nicer when converted to HTML on the web
  site.

* April 1, 2004
- Dirk Manske provided a new function that is now named ares_cancel(). It is
  used to cancel/cleanup a resolve/request made using ares functions on the
  given ares channel. It does not destroy/kill the ares channel itself.

- Dominick Meglio cleaned up the formatting in several man pages.

* March 30, 2004
- Dominick Meglio's new ares_expand_string. A helper function when decoding
  incoming DNS packages.

- Daniel Stenberg modified the Makefile.in to use a for loop for the man page
  installation to improve overview and make it easier to add man pages.

Version 1.1.0 (March 11, 2004)

* March 9, 2004
- Gisle Vanem improved build on Windows.

* February 25, 2004
- Dan Fandrich found a flaw in the Feb 22 fix.

- Added better configure --enable-debug logic (taken from the curl configure
  script). Added acinclude.m4 to the tarball.

* February 23, 2004
- Removed ares_free_errmem(), the function, the file and the man page. It was
  not used and it did nothing.

- Fixed a lot of code that wasn't "64bit clean" and thus caused a lot of
  compiler warnings on picky compilers.

* February 22, 2004
- Dominick Meglio made ares init support multiple name servers in the
  NameServer key on Windows.

* February 16, 2004
- Modified ares_private.h to include libcurl's memory debug header if
  CURLDEBUG is set. This makes all the ares-functions supervised properly by
  the curl test suite. This also forced me to add inclusion of the
  ares_private.h header in a few more files that are using some kind of
  memory-related resources.

- Made the makefile only build ahost and adig if 'make demos' is used.

* February 10, 2004
- Dirk Manske made ares_version.h installed with 'make install'

* February 4, 2004
- ares_free_errmem() is subject for removal, it is simply present for future
  purposes, and since we removed the extra parameter in strerror() it won't
  be used by c-ares!
- configure --enable-debug now enables picky compiler options if gcc is used
- fixed several compiler warnings --enable-debug showed and Joerg Mueller-Tolk
  reported

Version 1.0.0 (February 3, 2004)

* February 3, 2004
- now we produce the libcares.a library instead of the previous libares.a
  since we are no longer compatible

* February 2, 2004

- ares_strerror() has one argument less. This is the first official
  modification of the existing provided ares API.

* January 29, 2004

- Dirk Manske fixed how the socket is set non-blocking.

* January 4, 2004

- Dominick Meglio made the private gettimeofday() become ares_gettimeofday()
  instead in order to not pollute the name space and risk colliding with
  other libraries' versions of this function.

* October 24, 2003. Daniel Stenberg

  Added ares_version().

Version 1.0-pre1 (8 October 2003)

- James Bursa made it run on RISC OS

- Dominick Meglio made it run fine on NT4

- Duncan Wilcox made it work fine on Mac OS X

- Daniel Stenberg adjusted the windows port

- liren at vivisimo.com made the initial windows port

* Imported the sources from ares 1.1.1
