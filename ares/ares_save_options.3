.SH NAME
ares_save_options \- Save configuration values obtained from initialized ares_channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ares.h>
.PP
.B void ares_save_options(ares_channel \fIchannel\fP, struct ares_options *\fIoptions\fP, int *\fIoptmask\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_save_options
function saves the channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
into the options struct identified by
.IR options ,
and saves the mask of options which are set to the integer
pointer (passed by reference) identified by
.IR optmask .

The resultant options and optmask are then able to be
passed directly to ares_init_options.  When the options
are no longer needed, ares_destroy_options should be called
to free any associated memory.
