        Task<ToolResult> ExecuteAsync(string command);
        ValidationResult Validate(string command);
    }

    // Common result types
    public class ToolResult
    {
        public int ExitCode { get; set; }
        public string StdOut { get; set; }
        public string StdErr { get; set; }
        public TimeSpan ExecutionTime { get; set; }
    }

    // Shared utilities
    public class CommandLineParser { }
    public class GlobMatcher { }
    public class RegexEngine { }
}
```

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Many tools rely on Unix-specific system calls
- **Solution**: Abstraction layer with platform-specific implementations
- **Effort**: +30% development time

### 2. Performance Requirements
- **Challenge**: Tools like grep, rsync need to match native performance
- **Solution**: Heavy optimization, unsafe code where needed, SIMD
- **Effort**: +40% development time for optimization

### 3. Feature Completeness
- **Challenge**: Each tool has hundreds of flags and edge cases
- **Solution**: Incremental releases, core features first
- **Example**: GNU grep has 50+ command-line options

### 4. Testing Complexity
- **Challenge**: Each tool needs thousands of test cases
- **Solution**: Port existing test suites, property-based testing
- **Effort**: 1:1 ratio of test code to production code

### 5. Regex Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Different regex flavors (PCRE, ERE, BRE, etc.)
- **Solution**: Multiple regex engines or configuration
- **Effort**: Significant complexity for grep, sed, awk

## Market Analysis

### Potential Users
1. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Cross-platform build scripts
2. **Windows Developers**: Unix tools without WSL/Cygwin
3. **.NET Shops**: Native .NET implementations
4. **Cloud Functions**: Lightweight tool usage
5. **Educational**: Learning Unix tools

### Competitive Advantage
- Pure .NET, no external dependencies
- Consistent API across all tools
- Better Windows integration
- Async/await throughout
- Strongly typed options

### Existing Alternatives
- **WSL**: Full Linux but heavyweight
- **Cygwin**: Good but requires Cygwin environment
- **GnuWin32**: Outdated, no longer maintained
- **Busybox**: Limited functionality
- **Individual ports**: Inconsistent, scattered

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance**: May not match native C implementations
2. **Compatibility**: Edge cases in 40-year-old tools
3. **Complexity**: Some tools (awk, sed) are Turing-complete languages

### Business Risks
1. **Adoption**: Developers comfortable with existing solutions
2. **Maintenance**: Large surface area to maintain
3. **Scope Creep**: Pressure to add more tools

## Recommendation

### MVP Approach
Start with high-value, lower-complexity tools:
1. **grep** - Most used text search
2. **jq** - JSON is ubiquitous
3. **find** - File searching
4. **wget** - Builds on CurlDotNet

### Success Metrics
- 10,000+ NuGet downloads in first year
- Used in 100+ CI/CD pipelines
- Community contributions
- Performance within 2x of native tools

## Conclusion

UserlandDotNet is technically feasible but represents a massive undertaking. The full suite would be comparable in scope to major projects like Roslyn or .NET Core itself.

**Recommended approach**: Start with 4-5 high-value tools, prove the concept, then expand based on community demand. The "paste and it works" philosophy from CurlDotNet provides a solid foundation for the user experience.

### Key Success Factors
1. **Quality over Quantity**: Better to have 5 perfect tools than 50 mediocre ones
2. **Community Involvement**: Open source from day one
3. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship early, ship often
4. **Performance Focus**: Must be "good enough" vs native
5. **Documentation**: Extensive examples and migration guides
