VERSIONCHANGE=12

# libtool version:
VERSIONINFO=-version-info $(VERSIONCHANGE):$(VERSIONADD):$(VERSIONDEL)
# This flag accepts an argument of the form current[:revision[:age]]. So,
# passing -version-info 3:12:1 sets current to 3, revision to 12, and age to
# 1.
#
# Here's the simplified rule guide on how to change -version-info:
# (current version is C:R:A)
#
# 1. if there are only source changes, use C:R+1:A
# 2. if interfaces were added use C+1:0:A+1
# 3. if interfaces were removed, then use C+1:0:0
