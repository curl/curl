/*
 * Curl_des_set_odd_parity()
 *
 * This is used to apply odd parity to the given byte array. It is typically
 * used by when a cryptography engine does not have its own version.
 *
 * The function is a port of the Java based oddParity() function over at:
 *
 * https://davenport.sourceforge.net/ntlm.html
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * bytes       [in/out] - The data whose parity bits are to be adjusted for
 *                        odd parity.
 * len         [out]    - The length of the data.
