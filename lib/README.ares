          How To Build libcurl to Use ares For Asynch Name Resolves
          =========================================================

ares:
  ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu/pub/ATHENA/ares/ares-1.1.1.tar.gz
  http://curl.haxx.se/dev/ares-1.1.1.tar.gz
  http://curl.sourceforge.net/dev/ares-1.1.1.tar.gz
  
  c-ares, a patched and improved version of ares:
  http://curl.haxx.se/beta/arescurl-1.0-pre1.tar.gz

NOTE
  libcurl works with ares 1.1.1, but several patches and improvements have
  been put into the c-ares package which has made it more portable and better
  working on several platforms.

Build ares
==========

1. unpack the ares archive
2. cd ares-dir
3. ./configure
4. make

Build libcurl to use ares
=========================

1. name the ares source directory 'ares' in the curl source directory
2. ./configure --enable-ares
3. make

If the configure script enables IPv6 support you need to explicitly disable
that (--disable-ipv6) since ares isn't IPv6 compatible (yet).
