.SH NAME
curl_free - reclaim memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "void curl_free( char *" ptr " );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_free reclaims memory that has been obtained through a libcurl call.  Use
\fIcurl_free(3)\fP instead of free() to avoid anomalies that can result from
differences in memory management between your application and libcurl.

Passing in a NULL pointer in \fIptr\fP will make this function return
immediately with no action.
