# NAME

curl_url_set - set a URL part

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLUcode curl_url_set(CURLU *url,
                       CURLUPart part,
                       const char *content,
                       unsigned int flags);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

The *url* handle to work on, passed in as the first argument, must be a
handle previously created by curl_url(3) or curl_url_dup(3).

This function sets or updates individual URL components, or parts, held by the
URL object the handle identifies.

The *part* argument should identify the particular URL part (see list below)
to set or change, with *content* pointing to a null-terminated string with the
new contents for that URL part. The contents should be in the form and
encoding they would use in a URL: URL encoded.

When setting a part in the URL object that was previously already set, it
replaces the data that was previously stored for that part with the new
*content*.

The caller does not have to keep *content* around after a successful call
as this function copies the content.

Setting a part to a NULL pointer removes that part's contents from the *CURLU*
handle.

This function has an 8 MB maximum length limit for all provided input strings.
In the real world, excessively long fields in URLs cause problems even if this
function accepts them.

When setting or updating contents of individual URL parts, curl_url_set(3)
might accept data that would not be otherwise possible to set in the string
when it gets populated as a result of a full URL parse. Beware. If done so,
extracting a full URL later on from such components might render an invalid
URL.

The *flags* argument is a bitmask with independent features.

# PARTS

## CURLUPART_URL

Allows the full URL of the handle to be replaced. If the handle already is
populated with a URL, the new URL can be relative to the previous.

When successfully setting a new URL, relative or absolute, the handle contents
is replaced with the components of the newly set URL.

Pass a pointer to a null-terminated string to the *url* parameter. The string
must point to a correctly formatted "RFC 3986+" URL or be a NULL pointer. The
URL parser only understands and parses the subset of URLS that are
"hierarchical" and therefore contain a `://` separator - not the ones that are
normally specified with only a colon separator.

By default this API only parses URLs using schemes for protocols that are
supported built-in. To make libcurl parse URLs generically even for schemes it
does not know about, the **CURLU_NON_SUPPORT_SCHEME** flags bit must be set.
Otherwise, this function returns *CURLUE_UNSUPPORTED_SCHEME* for URL schemes
it does not recognize.

Unless *CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY* is set, a blank hostname is not allowed in
the URL.

When a full URL is set (parsed), the hostname component is stored URL decoded.

It is considered fine to set a blank URL ("") as a redirect, but not as a
normal URL. Therefore, setting a "" URL works fine if the handle already holds
a URL, otherwise it triggers an error.

## CURLUPART_SCHEME

Scheme cannot be URL decoded on set. libcurl only accepts setting schemes up
to 40 bytes long.

## CURLUPART_USER

If only the user part is set and not the password, the URL is represented with
a blank password.

## CURLUPART_PASSWORD

If only the password part is set and not the user, the URL is represented with
a blank user.

## CURLUPART_OPTIONS

The options field is an optional field that might follow the password in the
userinfo part. It is only recognized/used when parsing URLs for the following
schemes: pop3, smtp and imap. This function however allows users to
independently set this field.

## CURLUPART_HOST

The hostname. If it is International Domain Name (IDN) the string must then be
encoded as your locale says or UTF-8 (when WinIDN is used). If it is a
bracketed IPv6 numeric address it may contain a zone id (or you can use
*CURLUPART_ZONEID*).

Note that if you set an IPv6 address, it gets ruined and causes an error if
you also set the CURLU_URLENCODE flag.

Unless *CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY* is set, a blank hostname is not allowed to set.

## CURLUPART_ZONEID

If the hostname is a numeric IPv6 address, this field can also be set.

## CURLUPART_PORT

The port number cannot be URL encoded on set. The given port number is
provided as a string and the decimal number in it must be between 0 and
65535. Anything else returns an error.

## CURLUPART_PATH

If a path is set in the URL without a leading slash, a slash is prepended
automatically.

## CURLUPART_QUERY

The query part gets spaces converted to pluses when asked to URL encode on set
with the *CURLU_URLENCODE* bit.

If used together with the *CURLU_APPENDQUERY* bit, the provided part is
appended on the end of the existing query.

The question mark in the URL is not part of the actual query contents.

## CURLUPART_FRAGMENT

The hash sign in the URL is not part of the actual fragment contents.

# FLAGS

The flags argument is zero, one or more bits set in a bitmask.

## CURLU_APPENDQUERY

Can be used when setting the *CURLUPART_QUERY* component. The provided new
part is then appended at the end of the existing query - and if the previous
part did not end with an ampersand (&), an ampersand gets inserted before the
new appended part.

When *CURLU_APPENDQUERY* is used together with *CURLU_URLENCODE*, the
first '=' symbol is not URL encoded.

## CURLU_NON_SUPPORT_SCHEME

If set, allows curl_url_set(3) to set a non-supported scheme. It then of
course cannot know if the provided scheme is a valid one or not.

## CURLU_URLENCODE

When set, curl_url_set(3) URL encodes the part on entry, except for
**scheme**, **port** and **URL**.

When setting the path component with URL encoding enabled, the slash character
is skipped.

The query part gets space-to-plus converted before the URL conversion is
applied.

This URL encoding is charset unaware and converts the input in a byte-by-byte
manner.

## CURLU_DEFAULT_SCHEME

If set, allows the URL to be set without a scheme and then sets that to the
default scheme: HTTPS. Overrides the *CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME* option if both are
set.

## CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME

If set, allows the URL to be set without a scheme and it instead "guesses"
which scheme that was intended based on the hostname. If the outermost
subdomain name matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that scheme is
used, otherwise it picks HTTP. Conflicts with the *CURLU_DEFAULT_SCHEME*
option which takes precedence if both are set.

If guessing is not allowed and there is no default scheme set, trying to parse
a URL without a scheme returns error.

If the scheme ends up set as a result of guessing, i.e. it is not actually
present in the parsed URL, it can later be figured out by using the
**CURLU_NO_GUESS_SCHEME** flag when subsequently getting the URL or the scheme
with curl_url_get(3).

## CURLU_NO_AUTHORITY

If set, skips authority checks. The RFC allows individual schemes to omit the
host part (normally the only mandatory part of the authority), but libcurl
cannot know whether this is permitted for custom schemes. Specifying the flag
permits empty authority sections, similar to how file scheme is handled.

## CURLU_PATH_AS_IS

When set for **CURLUPART_URL**, this skips the normalization of the
path. That is the procedure where libcurl otherwise removes sequences of
dot-slash and dot-dot etc. The same option used for transfers is called
CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS(3).

## CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE

If set, the URL parser allows space (ASCII 32) where possible. The URL syntax
does normally not allow spaces anywhere, but they should be encoded as %20
or '+'. When spaces are allowed, they are still not allowed in the scheme.
When space is used and allowed in a URL, it is stored as-is unless
*CURLU_URLENCODE* is also set, which then makes libcurl URL encode the
space before stored. This affects how the URL is constructed when
curl_url_get(3) is subsequently used to extract the full URL or
individual parts. (Added in 7.78.0)

## CURLU_DISALLOW_USER

If set, the URL parser does not accept embedded credentials for the
**CURLUPART_URL**, and instead returns **CURLUE_USER_NOT_ALLOWED** for
such URLs.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURLUcode rc;
  CURLU *url = curl_url();
  rc = curl_url_set(url, CURLUPART_URL, "https://example.com", 0);
  if(!rc) {
    /* change it to an FTP URL */
    rc = curl_url_set(url, CURLUPART_SCHEME, "ftp", 0);
  }
  curl_url_cleanup(url);
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

Returns a *CURLUcode* error value, which is CURLUE_OK (0) if everything
went fine. See the libcurl-errors(3) man page for the full list with
descriptions.

The input string passed to curl_url_set(3) must be shorter than eight
million bytes. Otherwise this function returns **CURLUE_MALFORMED_INPUT**.

If this function returns an error, no URL part is set.
