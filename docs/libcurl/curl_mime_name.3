.TH curl_mime_name 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_name - set a mime part's name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_name(curl_mimepart * " part ", const char * " name
.BI ", size_t " namesize ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_name(3)\fP sets a mime part's name. This is the way HTTP form
fields are named.

\fIname\fP points to the name byte string; the string may contain nul bytes
unless \fInamesize\fP is -1.

\fInamesize\fP is the name length: it can be set to \fICURL_ZERO_TERMINATED\fP
to indicate \fIname\fP is a nul-terminated string.

\fIpart\fP is the part's handle to assign a name to.

The name string is copied into the part, thus the associated storage may
safely be released or reused after call. Setting a part's name twice is valid:
only the value set by the last call is retained. It is possible to "unname" a
part by setting \fIname\fP to NULL.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
