.SH NAME
libcurl-multi \- how to use the multi interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an overview on how to use the libcurl multi interface in your C
programs. There are specific man pages for each function mentioned in
here. There's also the libcurl-the-guide document for a complete tutorial to
programming with libcurl and the \fIlibcurl(3)\fP man page for an overview of
the libcurl easy interface.

All functions in the multi interface are prefixed with curl_multi.
.SH "OBJECTIVES"
The multi interface introduces several new abilities that the easy interface
refuses to offer. They are mainly:

1. Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses libcurl decides where
and when to ask libcurl to get/send data.

2. Enable multiple simultaneous transfers in the same thread without making it
complicated for the application.

3. Enable the application to select() on its own file descriptors and curl's
file descriptors simultaneous easily.
.SH "ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES"
To use the multi interface, you must first create a 'multi handle' with
\fIcurl_multi_init\fP. This handle is then used as input to all further
curl_multi_* functions.

Each single transfer is built up with an easy handle. You must create them,
and setup the appropriate options for each easy handle, as outlined in the
\fIlibcurl(3)\fP man page.

When the easy handle is setup for a transfer, then instead of using
\fIcurl_easy_perform\fP (as when using the easy interface for transfers), you
should instead add the easy handle to the multi handle using
\fIcurl_easy_add_handl\fP. The multi handle is sometimes referred to as a
\'multi stack\' because of the fact that it may hold a large amount of easy
handles.

Should you change your mind, the easy handle is again removed from the multi
stack using \fIcurl_multi_remove_handle\fP. Once removed from the multi
handle, you can again use other easy interface functions like
curl_easy_perform or whatever you think is necessary.

Adding the easy handles to the multi handle does not start any
transfer. Remember that one of the main ideas with this interface is to let
your application drive. You drive the transfers by invoking
\fIcurl_multi_perform\fP. libcurl will then transfer data if there is anything
available to transfer. It'll use the callbacks and everything else you have
setup in the individual easy handles. It'll transfer data on all current
transfers in the multi stack that are ready to transfer anything. It may be
all, it may be none.

Your application can acquire knowledge from libcurl when it would like to get
invoked to transfer data, so that you don't have to busy-loop and call that
\fIcurl_multi_perform\fP like a mad man! \fIcurl_multi_fdset\fP offers an
interface using which you can extract fd_sets from libcurl to use in select()
or poll() calls in order to get to know when the transfers in the multi stack
might need attention. This also makes it very easy for your program to wait
for input on your own private file descriptors at the same time or perhaps
timeout every now and then, should you want that.

\fIcurl_multi_perform\fP stores the number of still running transfers in one
of its input arguments, and by reading that you can figure out when all the
transfers in the multi handles are done. 'done' does not mean successful. One
or more of the transfers may have failed.

To get information about completed transfers, to figure out success or not and
similar, \fIcurl_multi_info_read\fP should be called. It can return a message
about a current or previous transfer. Repeated invokes of the function get
more messages until the message queue is empty.

When all transfers in the multi stack are done, cleanup the multi handle with
\fIcurl_multi_cleanup\fP. Be careful and please note that you \fBMUST\fP
invoke separate \fIcurl_easy_cleanup\fP calls on every single easy handle to
clean them up properly.
