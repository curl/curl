.SH NAME
curl_multi_timeout \- how long to wait for action before proceeding
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_timeout(CURLM *multi_handle, long *timeout);
.SH DESCRIPTION

An application using the libcurl multi interface should call
\fBcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP to figure out how long it should wait for socket
actions \- at most \- before proceeding.

Proceeding means either doing the socket-style timeout action: call the
\fBcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP function with the \fBsockfd\fP argument set to
CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT and the \fBeasy\fP argument set to CURL_EASY_TIMEOUT, or
simply calling \fBcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP if you're using the simpler and
older multi interface approach.

The timeout value returned in the long \fBtimeout\fP points to, is in number
of milliseconds at this very moment. If 0, it means you should proceed
immediately without waiting for anything. If it returns -1, there's no timeout
at all set.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The standard CURLMcode for multi interface error codes.
.SH "TYPICAL USAGE"
Call \fBcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP, then wait for action on the sockets. You
figure out which sockets to wait for by calling \fBcurl_multi_fdset(3)\fP or
by a previous call to \fBcurl_multi_socket(3)\fP.
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function was added in libcurl 7.15.4, although not deemed stable yet.
