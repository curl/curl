.TH curl_formget 3 "20 June 2006" "libcurl 7.15.5" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_formget - serialize a previously built multipart/formdata HTTP POST chain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "void curl_formget(struct curl_httppost *" form, " void *" arg,
.BI " curl_formget_callback " append ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_formget() is used to serialize data previously built/appended with
\fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP. Accepts a void pointer as second argument which will be
passed to the curl_formget_callback function.

.BI "typedef size_t (*curl_formget_callback)(void *" arg, " const char *" buf,
.BI " size_t " len ");"
.nf

The curl_formget_callback will be executed for each part of the HTTP POST
chain. The void *arg pointer will be the one passed as second argument to
curl_formget(). The character buffer passed to it must not be freed. The
callback should return the buffer length passed to it on success.
.SH RETURN VALUE
0 means everything was ok, non-zero means an error occurred
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf

 size_t print_httppost_callback(void *arg, const char *buf, size_t len)
 {
   fwrite(buf, len, 1, stdout);
   (*(size_t *) arg) += len;
   return len;
 }
 size_t print_httppost(struct curl_httppost *post)
 {
   size_t total_size = 0;
   if(curl_formget(post, &total_size, print_httppost_callback)) {
     return (size_t) -1;
   }
   return total_size;
 }
