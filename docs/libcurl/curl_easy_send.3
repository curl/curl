.TH curl_easy_send 3 "29 April 2008" "libcurl" "libcurl"
.SH NAME
curl_easy_send - sends raw data over an "easy" connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/easy.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_send(CURL *curl, const void *buffer,
                        size_t buflen, size_t *n);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function sends arbitrary data over the established connection. You may
use it together with \fIcurl_easy_recv(3)\fP to implement custom protocols
using libcurl. This functionality can be particularly useful if you use
proxies and/or SSL encryption: libcurl takes care of proxy negotiation and
connection setup.

\fBbuffer\fP is a pointer to the data of length \fBbuflen\fP that you want
sent. The variable \fBn\fP points to receives the number of sent bytes.

To establish the connection, set \fICURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY(3)\fP option before
calling \fIcurl_easy_perform(3)\fP or \fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP. Note that
\fIcurl_easy_send(3)\fP does not work on connections that were created without
this option.

The call returns \fBCURLE_AGAIN\fP if it's not possible to send data right now
- the socket is used in non-blocking mode internally. When \fBCURLE_AGAIN\fP
is returned, use your operating system facilities like \fIselect(2)\fP to wait
until the socket is writable. The socket may be obtained using
\fIcurl_easy_getinfo(3)\fP with \fICURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET(3)\fP.

Furthermore if you wait on the socket and it tells you it's writable,
\fIcurl_easy_send(3)\fP may return \fBCURLE_AGAIN\fP if the only data that was
sent was for internal SSL processing, and no other data could be sent.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
 /* Do not do the transfer - only connect to host */
 curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY, 1L);
 res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

 if(res == CURLE_OK) {
   /* Extract the socket from the curl handle - we need it for waiting. */
   res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_ACTIVESOCKET, &sockfd);

   /* send data */
   res = curl_easy_send(curl, "hello", 5, &sent);
 }
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.18.2.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, returns \fBCURLE_OK\fP and stores the number of bytes actually
sent into \fB*n\fP. Note that this may be less than the amount you wanted to
send.

On failure, returns the appropriate error code.

This function may return \fBCURLE_AGAIN\fP. In this case, use your operating
system facilities to wait until the socket is writable, and retry.

If there is no socket available to use from the previous transfer, this function
returns \fBCURLE_UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL\fP.
