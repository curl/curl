.TH curl_slist_append 3 "19 Jun 2003" "libcurl 7.10.4" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_slist_append - add a string to an slist
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "struct curl_slist *curl_slist_append(struct curl_slist *" list,
.BI "const char * "string ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
curl_slist_append() appends a specified string to a linked list of
strings. The existing \fIlist\fP should be passed as the first argument while
the new list is returned from this function. The specified \fIstring\fP has
been appended when this function returns. curl_slist_append() copies the
string.

The list should be freed again (after usage) with
\fBcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A null pointer is returned if anything went wrong, otherwise the new list
pointer is returned.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 CURL handle;
 struct curl_slist *slist=NULL;

 slist = curl_slist_append(slist, "pragma:");

 if (slist == NULL)
   return -1;

 curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, slist);

 curl_easy_perform(handle);

 curl_slist_free_all(slist); /* free the list again */
.fi
