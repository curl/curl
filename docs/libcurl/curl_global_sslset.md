# NAME

curl_global_sslset - select SSL backend to use

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLsslset curl_global_sslset(curl_sslbackend id,
                              const char *name,
                              const curl_ssl_backend ***avail);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

This function configures at runtime which SSL backend to use with
libcurl. This function can only be used to select an SSL backend once, and it
must be called **before** curl_global_init(3).

The backend can be identified by the *id*
(e.g. **CURLSSLBACKEND_OPENSSL**). The backend can also be specified via the
*name* parameter for a case insensitive match (passing
**CURLSSLBACKEND_NONE** as *id*). If both *id* and *name* are
specified, the *name* is ignored.

If neither *id* nor *name* are specified, the function fails with
**CURLSSLSET_UNKNOWN_BACKEND** and set the *avail* pointer to the
NULL-terminated list of available backends. The available backends are those
that this particular build of libcurl supports.

Since libcurl 7.60.0, the *avail* pointer is always set to the list of
alternatives if non-NULL.

Upon success, the function returns **CURLSSLSET_OK**.

If the specified SSL backend is not available, the function returns
**CURLSSLSET_UNKNOWN_BACKEND** and sets the *avail* pointer to a
NULL-terminated list of available SSL backends. In this case, you may call the
function again to try to select a different backend.

The SSL backend can be set only once. If it has already been set, a subsequent
attempt to change it results in a **CURLSSLSET_TOO_LATE** getting returned.

This function is thread-safe since libcurl 7.84.0 if
curl_version_info(3) has the CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE feature bit set
(most platforms).

If this is not thread-safe, you must not call this function when any other
thread in the program (i.e. a thread sharing the same memory) is running.
This does not just mean no other thread that is using libcurl.

# Names

SSL backend names (case-insensitive): GnuTLS, mbedTLS, OpenSSL, Rustls,
Schannel, wolfSSL

The name "OpenSSL" is used for all versions of OpenSSL and its associated
forks/flavors in this function. OpenSSL, BoringSSL, LibreSSL, quictls and
AmiSSL are all supported by libcurl, but in the eyes of curl_global_sslset(3)
they are all just "OpenSSL". They all mostly provide the same API.
curl_version_info(3) can return more specific info about the exact OpenSSL
flavor and version number in use.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  int i;
  /* choose a specific backend */
  curl_global_sslset(CURLSSLBACKEND_WOLFSSL, NULL, NULL);

  /* list the available ones */
  const curl_ssl_backend **list;
  curl_global_sslset(CURLSSLBACKEND_NONE, NULL, &list);

  for(i = 0; list[i]; i++)
    printf("SSL backend #%d: '%s' (ID: %d)\n",
           i, list[i]->name, list[i]->id);
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

If this function returns *CURLSSLSET_OK*, the backend was successfully
selected.

If the chosen backend is unknown (or support for the chosen backend has not
been compiled into libcurl), the function returns
*CURLSSLSET_UNKNOWN_BACKEND*.

If the backend had been configured previously, or if curl_global_init(3)
has already been called, the function returns *CURLSSLSET_TOO_LATE*.

If this libcurl was built completely without SSL support, with no backends at
all, this function returns *CURLSSLSET_NO_BACKENDS*.
