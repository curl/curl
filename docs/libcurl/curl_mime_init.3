.TH curl_mime_init 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_init - create a mime handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "curl_mime * curl_mime_init(CURL * " easy_handle ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_init(3)\fP creates a handle to a new empty mime structure
intended to be used with \fIeasy_handle\fP. This mime structure can be
subsequently filled using the mime API, then attached to \fIeasy_handle\fP
using option \fICURLOPT_MIMEPOST(3)\fP within a \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP
call.

Using a mime handle is the recommended way to post an HTTP form, format and
send a multi-part e-mail with SMTP or upload such an e-mail to an IMAP server.

.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
A mime struct handle, or NULL upon failure.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf

 CURL *easy = curl_easy_init();
 curl_mime *mime;
 curl_mimepart *part;

 /* Build an HTTP form with a single field named "data", */
 mime = curl_mime_init(easy);
 part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);
 curl_mime_data(part, "This is the field data", CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);
 curl_mime_name(part, "data");

 /* Post and send it. */
 curl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_MIMEPOST, mime);
 curl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
 curl_easy_perform(easy);

 /* Clean-up. */
 curl_easy_cleanup(easy);
 curl_mime_free(mime);
