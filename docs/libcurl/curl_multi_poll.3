.TH curl_multi_poll 3 "24 Mar 2018" "libcurl 7.60.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_multi_poll - polls on all easy handles in a multi handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_poll(CURLM *multi_handle,
                          struct curl_waitfd extra_fds[],
                          unsigned int extra_nfds,
                          int timeout_ms,
                          int *numfds);
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
Almost identical to \fIcurl_multi_wait(3)\fP.

\fIcurl_multi_poll(3)\fP polls all file descriptors used by the curl easy
handles contained in the given multi handle set.  It will block until activity
is detected on at least one of the handles or \fItimeout_ms\fP has passed.
Alternatively, if the multi handle has a pending internal timeout that has a
shorter expiry time than \fItimeout_ms\fP, that shorter time will be used
instead to make sure timeout accuracy is reasonably kept.

The calling application may pass additional curl_waitfd structures which are
similar to \fIpoll(2)\fP's pollfd structure to be waited on in the same call.

On completion, if \fInumfds\fP is non-NULL, it will be populated with the
total number of file descriptors on which interesting events occurred. This
number can include both libcurl internal descriptors as well as descriptors
provided in \fIextra_fds\fP.

If no extra file descriptors are provided and libcurl has no file descriptor
to offer to wait for, this function will wait for the timeout to expire. The
timeout will never be longer than \fItimeout_ms\fP milliseconds, but as
explained above it can be shorter at times.

This function is encouraged to be used instead of select(3) when using the
multi interface to allow applications to easier circumvent the common problem
with 1024 maximum file descriptors.
.SH curl_waitfd
.nf
struct curl_waitfd {
  curl_socket_t fd;
  short events;
  short revents;
};
.fi
.IP CURL_WAIT_POLLIN
Bit flag to curl_waitfd.events indicating the socket should poll on read
events such as new data received.
.IP CURL_WAIT_POLLPRI
Bit flag to curl_waitfd.events indicating the socket should poll on high
priority read events such as out of band data.
.IP CURL_WAIT_POLLOUT
Bit flag to curl_waitfd.events indicating the socket should poll on write
events such as the socket being clear to write without blocking.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *easy_handle;
CURLM *multi_handle;

/* add the individual easy handle */
curl_multi_add_handle(multi_handle, easy_handle);

do {
  curl_multi_poll(multi_handle, NULL, 0, 1000, NULL);

  curl_multi_perform(multi_handle, &still_running);

} while(still_running);

curl_multi_remove_handle(multi_handle, easy_handle);
.fi
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code. See
\fIlibcurl-errors(3)\fP
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function was added in libcurl 7.60.0.
