.SH NAME
curl_easy_getinfo - extract information from a curl handle
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>

.B "CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Request internal information from the curl session with this function.  The
third argument \fBMUST\fP be a pointer to a long, a pointer to a char *, a
pointer to a struct curl_slist * or a pointer to a double (as this
documentation describes further down).  The data pointed-to will be filled in
accordingly and can be relied upon only if the function returns CURLE_OK.  Use
this function AFTER a performed transfer if you want to get transfer- oriented
data.

You should not free the memory returned by this function unless it is
explictly mentioned below.
.SH AVAILABLE INFORMATION
The following information can be extracted:
.IP CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the last used effective URL.
.IP CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last received HTTP or FTP code. This
option was known as CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE in libcurl 7.10.7 and earlier. This
will be zero if no server response code has been received. Note that a proxy's
CONNECT response should be read with \fICURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE\fP and not
this.
.IP CURLINFO_HTTP_CONNECTCODE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last received proxy response code to a
CONNECT request.
.IP CURLINFO_FILETIME
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the remote time of the retrieved document
(in number of seconds since 1 jan 1970 in the GMT/UTC time zone). If you get
-1, it can be because of many reasons (unknown, the server hides it or the
server doesn't support the command that tells document time etc) and the time
of the document is unknown. Note that you must tell the server to collect this
information before the transfer is made, by using the CURLOPT_FILETIME option
to \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP or you will unconditionally get a -1 back. (Added
in 7.5)
.IP CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total transaction time in seconds
for the previous transfer. This time does not include the connect time, so if
you want the complete operation time, you should add the
CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME.
.IP CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the name resolving was completed.
.IP CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
.IP CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all
pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular
protocol(s) involved.
.IP CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the first byte is just about to be transferred. This includes
CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME and also the time the server needs to calculate
the result.
.IP CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total time, in seconds, it took for
all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer
before final transaction was started. CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME contains the
complete execution time for multiple redirections.  (Added in 7.9.7)
.IP CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total number of redirections that were
actually followed.  (Added in 7.9.7)
.IP CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were
uploaded.
.IP CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were
downloaded. The amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset again
for each new transfer.
.IP CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average download speed that curl
measured for the complete download.
.IP CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average upload speed that curl
measured for the complete upload.
.IP CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of all the headers
received.
.IP CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of the issued
requests. This is so far only for HTTP requests. Note that this may be more
than one request if FOLLOWLOCATION is true.
.IP CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the result of the certification
verification that was requested (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to
\fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP).
.IP CURLINFO_SSL_ENGINES
Pass the address of a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of
OpenSSL crypto-engines supported. Note that engines are normally implemented
in separate dynamic libraries. Hence not all the returned engines may be
available at run-time. \fBNOTE:\fP you must call \fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP
on the list pointer once you're done with it, as libcurl will not free the
data for you. (Added in 7.12.3)
.IP CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the content-length of the download. This
is the value read from the Content-Length: field.
.IP CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the specified size of the upload.
.IP CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the content-type of the downloaded
object. This is the value read from the Content-Type: field. If you get NULL,
it means that the server didn't send a valid Content-Type header or that the
protocol used doesn't support this.
.IP CURLINFO_PRIVATE
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the pointer to the private data
associated with the curl handle (set with the CURLOPT_PRIVATE option to
\fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP). (Added in 7.10.3)
.IP CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_AVAIL
Pass a pointer to a long to receive a bitmask indicating the authentication
method(s) available. The meaning of the bits is explained in the
CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH option for \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP.  (Added in 7.10.8)
.IP CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_AVAIL
Pass a pointer to a long to receive a bitmask indicating the authentication
method(s) available for your proxy authentication.  (Added in 7.10.8)
.IP CURLINFO_OS_ERRNO
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the errno variable from a connect failure.
(Added in 7.12.2)
.IP CURLINFO_NUM_CONNECTS
Pass a pointer to a long to receive how many new connections libcurl had to
create to achieve the previous transfer (only the successful connects are
counted).  Combined with \fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT\fP you are able to know
how many times libcurl successfully reused existing connection(s) or not.  See
the Connection Options of \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP to see how libcurl tries
to make persistent connections to save time.  (Added in 7.12.3)
.IP CURLINFO_COOKIELIST
Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of all
cookies cURL knows (expired ones, too). Don't forget to
\fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP the list after it has been used.  If there are no
cookies (cookies for the handle have not been enabled or simply none have been
received) 'struct curl_slist *' will be set to point to NULL. (Added in
7.14.1)
.IP CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last socket used by this curl
session. If the socket is no longer valid, -1 is returned. When you finish
working with the socket, you must call curl_easy_cleanup() as usual and let
libcurl close the socket and cleanup other resources associated with the
handle. (Added in 7.15.2)
.SH TIMES

An overview of the six time values available from curl_easy_getinfo()

curk_easy_perform()
    |
    |--NT
    |--|--CT
    |--|--|--PT
    |--|--|--|--ST
          |--|--|--TT
    |--|--|--|--|--RT
.FI
.IP NT
\fICURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the name
resolving was completed.
.IP CT
\fICURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the connect
to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
.IP PT
\fICURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the
file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all pre-transfer commands
and negotiations that are specific to the particular protocol(s) involved.
.IP ST
\fICURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME\fP. The time it took from the start until the
first byte is just about to be transferred.
.IP TT
\fICURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME\fP. Time of the previous transfer. This time does not
include the connect time (CT), so if you want the complete operation time, you
should add that.
.IP RT
\fICURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME\fP. The time it took for all redirection steps
include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer before final
transaction was started. So, this is zero if no redirection took place.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the operation was successful, CURLE_OK is returned. Otherwise an
appropriate error code will be returned.
