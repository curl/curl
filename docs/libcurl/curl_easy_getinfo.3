.SH NAME
curl_easy_getinfo - Extract information from a curl session (added in 7.4)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
Request internal information from the curl session with this function.  The
third argument
.B MUST
be a pointer to a long, a pointer to a char * or a pointer to a double (as
this documentation describes further down).  The data pointed-to will be
filled in accordingly and can be relied upon only if the function returns
CURLE_OK.  This function is intended to get used *AFTER* a performed transfer,
all results from this function are undefined until the transfer is completed.
.SH AVAILABLE INFORMATION
These are informations that can be extracted:
.TP 0.8i
.B CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the last used effective URL.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the last received HTTP code.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_FILETIME
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the remote time of the retrieved
document. If you get -1, it can be because of many reasons (unknown, the
server hides it or the server doesn't support the command that tells document
time etc) and the time of the document is unknown. Note that you must tell the
server to collect this information before the transfer is made, by using the
CURLOPT_FILETIME option to \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP. (Added in 7.5)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total transaction time in seconds
for the previous transfer. This time does not include the connect time, so if
you want the complete operation time, you should add the
CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the name resolving was completed.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the connect to the remote host (or proxy) was completed.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the file transfer is just about to begin. This includes all
pre-transfer commands and negotiations that are specific to the particular
protocol(s) involved.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the time, in seconds, it took from the
start until the first byte is just about to be transfered. This includes
CURLINFO_PRETRANSFER_TIME and also the time the server needs to calculate
the result.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total time, in seconds, it took for
all redirection steps include name lookup, connect, pretransfer and transfer
before final transaction was started. CURLINFO_REDIRECT_TIME contains the
complete execution time for multiple redirections.  (Added in 7.9.7)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_REDIRECT_COUNT
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total number of redirections that were
actually followed.  (Added in 7.9.7)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_SIZE_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were
uploaded.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_SIZE_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the total amount of bytes that were
downloaded. The amount is only for the latest transfer and will be reset again
for each new transfer.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_SPEED_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average download speed that curl
measured for the complete download.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_SPEED_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the average upload speed that curl
measured for the complete upload.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of all the headers
received.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the total size of the issued
requests. This is so far only for HTTP requests. Note that this may be more
than one request if FOLLOWLOCATION is true.
.TP
.B CURLINFO_SSL_VERIFYRESULT
Pass a pointer to a long to receive the result of the certification
verification that was requested (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option to
curl_easy_setopt). (Added in 7.4.2)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the content-length of the download. This
is the value read from the Content-Length: field.  (Added in 7.6.1)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_UPLOAD
Pass a pointer to a double to receive the specified size of the upload.
(Added in 7.6.1)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the content-type of the downloaded
object. This is the value read from the Content-Type: field. If you get NULL,
it means that the server didn't send a valid Content-Type header or that the
protocol used doesn't support this.  (Added in 7.9.4)
.TP
.B CURLINFO_PRIVATE
Pass a pointer to a 'char *' to receive the pointer to the private data
