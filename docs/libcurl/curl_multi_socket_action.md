# NAME

curl_multi_socket_action - read/write available data given an action

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_socket_action(CURLM *multi_handle,
                                   curl_socket_t sockfd,
                                   int ev_bitmask,
                                   int *running_handles);

# DESCRIPTION

When the application has detected action on a socket handled by libcurl, it
should call curl_multi_socket_action(3) with the **sockfd** argument
set to the socket with the action. When the events on a socket are known, they
can be passed as an events bitmask **ev_bitmask** by first setting
**ev_bitmask** to 0, and then adding using bitwise OR (|) any combination of
events to be chosen from CURL_CSELECT_IN, CURL_CSELECT_OUT or
CURL_CSELECT_ERR. When the events on a socket are unknown, pass 0 instead, and
libcurl tests the descriptor internally. It is also permissible to pass
CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT to the **sockfd** parameter in order to initiate the
whole process or when a timeout occurs.

At return, **running_handles** points to the number of running easy handles
within the multi handle. When this number reaches zero, all transfers are
complete/done. When you call curl_multi_socket_action(3) on a specific
socket and the counter decreases by one, it DOES NOT necessarily mean that
this exact socket/transfer is the one that completed. Use
curl_multi_info_read(3) to figure out which easy handle that completed.

The curl_multi_socket_action(3) function informs the application about
updates in the socket (file descriptor) status by doing none, one, or multiple
calls to the socket callback function set with the
CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION(3) option to curl_multi_setopt(3). They
update the status with changes since the previous time the callback was
called.

Get the timeout time by setting the CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION(3) option
with curl_multi_setopt(3). Your application then gets called with
information on how long to wait for socket actions at most before doing the
timeout action: call the curl_multi_socket_action(3) function with the
**sockfd** argument set to CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT. You can also use the
curl_multi_timeout(3) function to poll the value at any given time, but
for an event-based system using the callback is far better than relying on
polling the timeout value.

When this function returns error, the state of all transfers are uncertain and
they cannot be continued. curl_multi_socket_action(3) should not be
called again on the same multi handle after an error has been returned, unless
first removing all the handles and adding new ones.

# TYPICAL USAGE

1. Create a multi handle

2. Set the socket callback with CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION(3)

3. Set the timeout callback with CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION(3), to get to
know what timeout value to use when waiting for socket activities.

4. Add easy handles with curl_multi_add_handle()

5. Provide some means to manage the sockets libcurl is using, so you can check
them for activity. This can be done through your application code, or by way
of an external library such as libevent or glib.

6. Call curl_multi_socket_action(..., CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT, 0, ...)
to kickstart everything. To get one or more callbacks called.

7. Wait for activity on any of libcurl's sockets, use the timeout value your
callback has been told.

8, When activity is detected, call curl_multi_socket_action() for the
socket(s) that got action. If no activity is detected and the timeout expires,
call curl_multi_socket_action(3) with *CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT*.

# %PROTOCOLS%

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  /* the event-library gets told when there activity on the socket 'fd',
     which we translate to a call to curl_multi_socket_action() */
  int running = 0;
  int fd = 3; /* the descriptor that had action */
  int bitmask = 2; /* what activity that happened */

  CURLM *multi = curl_multi_init();

  CURLMcode mc = curl_multi_socket_action(multi, fd, bitmask, &running);
  if(mc)
    printf("error: %s\n", curl_multi_strerror(mc));
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

This function returns a CURLMcode indicating success or error.

CURLM_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
