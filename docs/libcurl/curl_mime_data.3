.TH curl_mime_data 3 "22 August 2017" "libcurl 7.56.0" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_mime_data - set a mime part's body data from memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLcode curl_mime_data(curl_mimepart * " part ", const char * " data
.BI ", size_t " datasize ");"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_mime_data(3)\fP sets a mime part's body content from memory data.

\fIdata\fP points to the data bytes: those are copied to the part and their
storage may safely be reused after call.
\fIdatasize\fP is the number of data bytes: it can be set to
\fICURL_ZERO_TERMINATED\fP to indicate \fIdata\fP is a null-terminated
character string.
\fIpart\fP is the part's to assign contents to.

Setting a part's contents twice is valid: only the value set by the last call
is retained. It is possible to unassign part's contents by setting
\fIdata\fP to NULL.

Setting very large data is memory consuming: one might consider using
\fIcurl_mime_data_cb(3)\fP in such a case.
.SH AVAILABILITY
As long as at least one of HTTP, SMTP or IMAP is enabled. Added in 7.56.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
CURLE_OK or a CURL error code upon failure.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 curl_mime *mime;
 curl_mimepart *part;

 /* create a mime handle */
 mime = curl_mime_init(easy);

 /* add a part */
 part = curl_mime_addpart(mime);

 /* add data to the part  */
 curl_mime_data(part, "raw contents to send", CURL_ZERO_TERMINATED);
