.SH NAME
curl_getdate - Convert a date string to number of seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "time_t curl_getdate(char *" datestring ", time_t *"now " );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcurl_getdate(3)\fP returns the number of seconds since the Epoch, January
1st 1970 00:00:00 in the UTC time zone, for the date and time that the
\fIdatestring\fP parameter specifies. The \fInow\fP parameter is not used,
pass a NULL there.
.SH PARSING DATES AND TIMES
A "date" is a string containing several items separated by whitespace. The
order of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain many flavors of
items:
.TP 0.8i
.B calendar date items
Can be specified several ways. Month names can only be three-letter english
abbreviations, numbers can be zero-prefixed and the year may use 2 or 4 digits.
Examples: 06 Nov 1994, 06-Nov-94 and Nov-94 6.
.TP
.B time of the day items
This string specifies the time on a given day. You must specify it with 6
digits with two colons: HH:MM:SS. To not include the time in a date string,
will make the function assume 00:00:00. Example: 18:19:21.
.TP
.B time zone items
Specifies international time zone. There are a few acronyms supported, but in
general you should instead use the specific relative time compared to
UTC. Supported formats include: -1200, MST, +0100.
.TP
.B day of the week items
Specifies a day of the week. Days of the week may be spelled out in full
(using english): `Sunday', `Monday', etc or they may be abbreviated to their
first three letters. This is usually not info that adds anything.
.TP
.B pure numbers
If a decimal number of the form YYYYMMDD appears, then YYYY is read as the
year, MM as the month number and DD as the day of the month, for the specified
calendar date.

.SH STANDARDS
This parser was written to handle date formats specified in RFC 822 (including
the update in RFC 1123) using time zone name or time zone delta and RFC 850
(obsoleted by RFC 1036) and ANSI C's asctime() format. These formats are the
only ones RFC2616 says HTTP applications may use.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function returns -1 when it fails to parse the date string. Otherwise it
returns the number of seconds as described.

If the year is larger than 2037 on systems with 32 bit time_t, this function
will return 0x7fffffff (since that is the largest possible signed 32 bit
number).

Having a 64 bit time_t is not a guarantee that dates beyond 03:14:07 UTC,
January 19, 2038 will work fine. On systems with a 64 bit time_t but with a
crippled mktime(), \fIcurl_getdate(3)\fP will return -1 in this case.
