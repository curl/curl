.TH CURLINFO_COOKIELIST 3 "1 Sep 2015" "libcurl 7.44.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_COOKIELIST \- get all known cookies
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_COOKIELIST,
                           struct curl_slist **cookies);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a 'struct curl_slist *' to receive a linked-list of all
cookies cURL knows (expired ones, too). Don't forget to call
\fIcurl_slist_free_all(3)\fP on the list after it has been used.  If there are
no cookies (cookies for the handle have not been enabled or simply none have
been received) 'struct curl_slist *' will be set to point to NULL.

Since 7.43.0 cookies that were imported in the Set-Cookie format without a
domain name are not exported by this option.
