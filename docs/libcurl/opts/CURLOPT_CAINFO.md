# NAME

CURLOPT_CAINFO - path to Certificate Authority (CA) bundle

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CAINFO, char *path);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a char pointer to a null-terminated string naming a file holding one or
more certificates to verify the peer with.

If CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3) is zero and you avoid verifying the
server's certificate, CURLOPT_CAINFO(3) need not even indicate an
accessible file.

This option is by default set to the system path where libcurl's CA
certificate bundle is assumed to be stored, as established at build time.

(Schannel) This option is supported for Schannel in Windows 7 or later but we
recommend not using it until Windows 8 since it works better starting then.
If the option is not set, then curl uses the certificates in the Windows'
store of root certificates (the default for Schannel).

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.

The default value for this can be figured out with CURLINFO_CAINFO(3).

# DEFAULT

Built-in system specific. When curl is built with Schannel, this option is not
set by default.

# %PROTOCOLS%

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO, "/etc/certs/cabundle.pem");
    curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
~~~

# HISTORY

Schannel support added in libcurl 7.60.

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
