.TH CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE 3 "1 Sep 2015" "libcurl 7.44.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE \- get Content-Type
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE, char **ct);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the content-type of the downloaded
object. This is the value read from the Content-Type: field. If you get NULL,
it means that the server didn't send a valid Content-Type header or that the
protocol used doesn't support this.

The \fBct\fP pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT
free it - it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the
corresponding CURL handle.

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

    /* extract the content-type */
    char *ct = NULL;
    res = curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_CONTENT_TYPE, &ct);
    if(!res && ct) {
