.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SASL_AUTHZID \- authorisation identity (identity to act as)
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SASL_AUTHZID, char *authzid);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as parameter, which should be pointing to the null-terminated
authorisation identity (authzid) for the transfer. Only applicable to the PLAIN
SASL authentication mechanism where it is optional.

used to access another user's inbox, that the user has been granted access to,
or a shared mailbox for example.
