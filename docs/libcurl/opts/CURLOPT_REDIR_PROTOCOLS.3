.SH NAME
CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS \- set protocols allowed to redirect to
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS, long bitmask);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long that holds a bitmask of CURLPROTO_* defines. If used, this bitmask
limits what protocols libcurl may use in a transfer that it follows to in a
redirect when \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP is enabled. This allows you to
limit specific transfers to only be allowed to use a subset of protocols in
redirections. By default libcurl will allow all protocols except for FILE and
SCP.
.SH DEFAULT
All protocols except for FILE and SCP
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
TODO
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.19.4, before then it would follow all protocols.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS "(3), "
