.TH CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE 3 "4 Nov 2014" "libcurl 7.39.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE \- chunk length threshold for pipelining
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE,
                            long size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
No function since pipelining was removed in 7.62.0.

Pass a long with a \fBsize\fP in bytes. If a transfer in a pipeline is
currently processing a chunked (Transfer-encoding: chunked) request with a
current chunk length larger than \fICURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE(3)\fP,
that pipeline will not be considered for additional requests, even if it is
shorter than \fICURLMOPT_MAX_PIPELINE_LENGTH(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
The default value is 0, which means that the penalization is inactive.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
long maxchunk = 10000;
curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_CHUNK_LENGTH_PENALTY_SIZE, maxchunk);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.30.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLM_OK if the option is supported, and CURLM_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
