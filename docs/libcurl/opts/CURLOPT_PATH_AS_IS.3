.TH CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.42.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS \- do not handle dot dot sequences
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS, long leaveit);
.SH DESCRIPTION
By setting the long \fIleaveit\fP to 1, to explicitly tell libcurl to not alter
the given path before passing it on to the server.

This tells libcurl to NOT squash sequences of "/../" or "/./" that may exist
in the URL's path part and that is supposed to be removed according to RFC
3986 section 5.2.4.

Some server implementations are known to (erroneously) require the dot dot
sequences to remain in the path and some clients want to pass these on in
order to try out server implementations.

By default libcurl will merge such sequences before using the path.
