.TH CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE \- size of POST data pointed to
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, long size);
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you want to post data to the server without having libcurl do a strlen() to
measure the data size, this option must be used. When this option is used you
can post fully binary data, which otherwise is likely to fail. If this size is
set to -1, the library will use strlen() to get the size.

If you post more than 2GB, use \fICURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE_LARGE(3)\fP.
.SH DEFAULT
-1
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP

CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE, (long) strlen(data));

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, data);

  curl_easy_perform(curl);
