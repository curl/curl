.TH CURLOPT_NETRC 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_NETRC \- request that .netrc is used
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_NETRC, long level);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This parameter controls the preference \fIlevel\fP of libcurl between using
user names and passwords from your \fI~/.netrc\fP file, relative to user names
and passwords in the URL supplied with \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP. On Windows,
libcurl will use the file as \fI%HOME%/_netrc\fP, but you can also tell
libcurl a different file name to use with \fICURLOPT_NETRC_FILE(3)\fP.

libcurl uses a user name (and supplied or prompted password) supplied with
\fICURLOPT_USERPWD(3)\fP or \fICURLOPT_USERNAME(3)\fP in preference to any of
the options controlled by this parameter.

Only machine name, user name and password are taken into account (init macros
and similar things aren't supported).

libcurl does not verify that the file has the correct properties set (as the
standard Unix ftp client does). It should only be readable by user.

\fIlevel\fP should be set to one of the values described below.

.IP CURL_NETRC_OPTIONAL
The use of your \fI~/.netrc\fP file is optional, and information in the URL is
to be preferred.  The file will be scanned for the host and user name (to
find the password only) or for the host only, to find the first user name and
password after that \fImachine\fP, which ever information is not specified in
the URL.

Undefined values of the option will have this effect.
.IP CURL_NETRC_IGNORED
The library will ignore the file and use only the information in the URL.

This is the default.
.IP CURL_NETRC_REQUIRED
This value tells the library that use of the file is required, to ignore the
information in the URL, and to search the file for the host only.
.SH DEFAULT
CURL_NETRC_IGNORED
