.TH CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE \- set type of the private key file
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLKEYTYPE, char *type);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
the format of your private key. Supported formats are "PEM", "DER" and "ENG".

The format "ENG" enables you to load the private key from a crypto engine. In
this case \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY(3)\fP is used as an identifier passed to the
engine. You have to set the crypto engine with \fICURLOPT_SSLENGINE(3)\fP.
\&"DER" format key file currently does not work because of a bug in OpenSSL.
.SH DEFAULT
"PEM"
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
TODO
.SH AVAILABILITY
If built TLS enabled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if TLS is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR CURLOPT_SSLKEY "(3), " CURLOPT_SSLCERT "(3), "
