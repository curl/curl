.TH CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN 3 "18 Apr 2019" "libcurl 7.65.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN \- max idle time allowed for reusing a connection
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN, long maxage);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter containing \fImaxage\fP - the maximum time in seconds
that you allow an existing connection to have to be considered for reuse for
this request.

The "connection cache" that holds previously used connections. When a new
request is to be done, it will consider any connection that matches for
reuse. The \fICURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN(3)\fP limit prevents libcurl from trying
very old connections for reuse, since old connections have a high risk of not
working and thus trying them is a performance loss and sometimes service loss
due to the difficulties to figure out the situation. If a connection is found
in the cache that is older than this set \fImaxage\fP, it will instead be
closed.
.SH DEFAULT
Default maxage is 118 seconds.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN, 30L);

  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
