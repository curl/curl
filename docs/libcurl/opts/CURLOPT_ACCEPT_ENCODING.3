.TH CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING \- enables automatic decompression of HTTP downloads
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING, char *enc);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * argument specifying what encoding you'd like.

Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header sent in a HTTP request, and
enables decoding of a response when a Content-Encoding: header is received.
Three encodings are supported: \fIidentity\fP, which does nothing,
\fIdeflate\fP which requests the server to compress its response using the
zlib algorithm, and \fIgzip\fP which requests the gzip algorithm.

If a zero-length string is set like "", then an Accept-Encoding: header
containing all built-in supported encodings is sent.

You can also opt to just include the Accept-Encoding: header in your request
with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP but then there will be no automatic
decompressing when receiving data.

This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.  This option
must be set (to any non-NULL value) or else any unsolicited encoding done by
the server is ignored. See the special file lib/README.encoding for further
details.
