    /* enable TCP keep-alive for this transfer */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE, 1L);

    /* set keep-alive idle time to 120 seconds */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE, 120L);

    /* interval time between keep-alive probes: 60 seconds */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL, 60L);

    /* maximum number of keep-alive probes: 3 */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPCNT, 3L);
