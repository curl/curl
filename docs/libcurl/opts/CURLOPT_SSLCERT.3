.TH CURLOPT_SSLCERT 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_SSLCERT \- set SSL client certificate
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSLCERT, char *cert);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a zero terminated string as parameter. The string should be
the file name of your client certificate. The default format is "P12" on
Secure Transport and "PEM" on other engines, and can be changed with
\fICURLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE(3)\fP.

With NSS or Secure Transport, this can also be the nickname of the certificate
you wish to authenticate with as it is named in the security database. If you
want to use a file from the current directory, please precede it with "./"
prefix, in order to avoid confusion with a nickname.

(Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a path expression to
a certificate store. (Loading PFX is not supported; you can import it to a
store first). You can use "<store location>\\<store name>\\<thumbprint>" to
refer to a certificate in the system certificates store, for example,
"CurrentUser\\MY\\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a". Thumbprint is
usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see in certificate details. Following
store locations are supported: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, CurrentService,
Services, CurrentUserGroupPolicy, LocalMachineGroupPolicy,
LocalMachineEnterprise.

When using a client certificate, you most likely also need to provide a
private key with \fICURLOPT_SSLKEY(3)\fP.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSLKEY, "key.pem");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_KEYPASSWD, "s3cret");
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
