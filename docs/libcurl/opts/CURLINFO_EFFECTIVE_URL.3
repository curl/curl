.TH CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL 3 "28 Aug 2015" "libcurl 7.44.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL \- get the last used URL
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL, char **urlp);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass in a pointer to a char pointer and get the last used effective URL.

In cases when you've asked libcurl to follow redirects, it may very well not
be the same value you set with \fICURLOPT_URL(3)\fP.

The \fBurlp\fP pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT
free - it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the
corresponding CURL handle.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  CURLcode res;
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1L);
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  if(res == CURLE_OK) {
    char *url = NULL;
    curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL, &url);
    if(url)
      printf("Redirect to: %s\\n", url);
  }
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
