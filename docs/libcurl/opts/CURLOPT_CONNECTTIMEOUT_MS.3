.TH CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS \- timeout for the connect phase
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS, long timeout);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in milliseconds that you allow
the connection phase to the server to take.  This only limits the connection
phase, it has no impact once it has connected. Set to zero to switch to the
default built-in connection timeout - 300 seconds. See also the
\fICURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS(3)\fP option.

In unix-like systems, this might cause signals to be used unless
\fICURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)\fP is set.

300000
