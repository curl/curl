# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
shown above.

It gets called when the known_host matching has been done, to allow the
application to act and decide for libcurl how to proceed. The callback is only
called if CURLOPT_SSH_KNOWNHOSTS(3) is also set.

This callback function gets passed the curl handle, the key from the
known_hosts file *knownkey*, the key from the remote site *foundkey*, info
from libcurl on the matching status and a custom pointer (set with
CURLOPT_SSH_KEYDATA(3)). It must return one of the following return codes to
tell libcurl how to act:

## CURLKHSTAT_FINE_REPLACE

The new host+key is accepted and libcurl replaces the old host+key into the
known_hosts file before continuing with the connection. This also adds the new
host+key combo to the known_host pool kept in memory if it was not already
present there. The adding of data to the file is done by completely replacing
the file with a new copy, so the permissions of the file must allow
this. (Added in 7.73.0)

## CURLKHSTAT_FINE_ADD_TO_FILE

The host+key is accepted and libcurl appends it to the known_hosts file before
continuing with the connection. This also adds the host+key combo to the
known_host pool kept in memory if it was not already present there. The adding
of data to the file is done by completely replacing the file with a new copy,
so the permissions of the file must allow this.

## CURLKHSTAT_FINE

The host+key is accepted libcurl continues with the connection. This also adds
the host+key combo to the known_host pool kept in memory if it was not already
present there.

## CURLKHSTAT_REJECT

The host+key is rejected. libcurl denies the connection to continue and it is
closed.

## CURLKHSTAT_DEFER

The host+key is rejected, but the SSH connection is asked to be kept alive.
This feature could be used when the app wants to return and act on the
host+key situation and then retry without needing the overhead of setting it
up from scratch again.

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
