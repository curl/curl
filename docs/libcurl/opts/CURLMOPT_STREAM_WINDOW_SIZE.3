.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_STREAM_WINDOW_SIZE \- set stream window size for http2
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_STREAM_WINDOW_SIZE,
                            long size);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long indicating the sender's HTTP/2 initial stream window \fBsize\fP in
bytes. This setting affects the initial window size of all streams. When using
\fIcurl_easy_pause(3)\fP, this value is also the maximum number of bytes

This option is for the multi handle's use only. When using the easy interface,
you should instead use the \fICURLOPT_STREAM_WINDOW_SIZE(3)\fP option.

Valid values range from 1 to 2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF).

33554432 (32 megabytes)
