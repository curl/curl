.TH CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL 3 "28 Aug 2015" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL \- get the URL a redirect would go to
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL, char **urlp);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the URL a redirect \fIwould\fP
take you to if you would enable \fICURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)\fP. This can come
handy if you think using the built-in libcurl redirect logic is not good enough
for you but you would still prefer to avoid implementing all the magic of
figuring out the new URL.

This URL is also set if the \fICURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)\fP limit prevented a
redirect to happen (since 7.54.1).
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP(S)
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    if(res == CURLE_OK) {
      char *url = NULL;
      curl_easy_getinfo(curl, CURLINFO_REDIRECT_URL, &url);
      if(url)
        printf("Redirect to: %s\\n", url);
    }
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.18.2
