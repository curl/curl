.TH CURLOPT_DOH_URL 3 "18 Jun 2018" "libcurl 7.62.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_DOH_URL \- provide the DNS-over-HTTPS URL
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_DOH_URL, char *URL);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass in a pointer to a \fIURL\fP for the DoH server to use for name
resolving. The parameter should be a char * to a null-terminated string which
must be URL-encoded in the following format: "https://host:port/path". It MUST
specify a HTTPS URL.

libcurl doesn't validate the syntax or use this variable until the transfer is
issued. Even if you set a crazy value here, \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP will
still return \fICURLE_OK\fP.

curl sends POST requests to the given DNS-over-HTTPS URL.

To find the DoH server itself, which might be specified using a name, libcurl
will use the default name lookup function. You can bootstrap that by providing
the address for the DoH server with \fICURLOPT_RESOLVE(3)\fP.

Disable DoH use again by setting this option to NULL.

\fBAdvanced:\fP The DoH lookups use SSL so some SSL settings from your transfer
are inherited. The hostname and peer certificate verification settings are not
inherited and can be controlled separately via
\fICURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP.
Note \fICURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION(3)\fP is inherited.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL - there is no default DoH URL. If this option isn't set, libcurl will use
the default name resolver.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_DOH_URL, "https://dns.example.com");
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.62.0
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK on success or CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient
heap space.

Note that \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP won't actually parse the given string so
given a bad DoH URL, curl will not detect a problem until it tries to resolve
a name with it.
