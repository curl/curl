.TH CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM \- set a point to resume transfer from
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM, long from);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long as parameter. It contains the offset in number of bytes that you
want the transfer to start from. Set this option to 0 to make the transfer
start from the beginning (effectively disabling resume). For FTP, set this
option to -1 to make the transfer start from the end of the target file
(useful to continue an interrupted upload).

When doing uploads with FTP, the resume position is where in the local/source
file libcurl should try to resume the upload from and it will then append the
source file to the remote target file.

If you need to resume a transfer beyond the 2GB limit, use
\fICURLOPT_RESUME_FROM_LARGE(3)\fP instead.
