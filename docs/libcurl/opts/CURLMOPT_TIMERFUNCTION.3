.TH CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION 3 "17 Jun 2014" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION \- callback to receive timeout values
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

int timer_callback(CURLM *multi,    /* multi handle */
                   long timeout_ms, /* timeout in number of ms */
                   void *clientp);    /* private callback pointer */

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION, timer_callback);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
shown above.

Certain features, such as timeouts and retries, require you to call libcurl
even when there is no activity on the file descriptors.

Your callback function \fBtimer_callback\fP should install a non-repeating
timer with an expire time of \fBtimeout_ms\fP milliseconds. When that timer
fires, call either \fIcurl_multi_socket_action(3)\fP or
\fIcurl_multi_perform(3)\fP, depending on which interface you use.

A \fBtimeout_ms\fP value of -1 passed to this callback means you should delete
the timer. All other values are valid expire times in number of milliseconds.

The \fBtimer_callback\fP is called when the timeout expire time is changed.

The \fBclientp\fP pointer is set with \fICURLMOPT_TIMERDATA(3)\fP.

The timer callback should return 0 on success, and -1 on error. If this
callback returns error, \fBall\fP transfers currently in progress in this
multi handle are aborted and made to fail.

This callback can be used instead of, or in addition to,
\fIcurl_multi_timeout(3)\fP.

\fBWARNING:\fP do not call libcurl directly from within the callback itself
when the \fBtimeout_ms\fP value is zero, since it risks triggering an
unpleasant recursive behavior that immediately calls another call to the
callback with a zero timeout...
