.TH CURLOPT_TRAILERFUNCTION 3 "14 Aug 2018" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_TRAILERFUNCTION \- callback for sending trailing headers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl.h>

int curl_trailer_callback(struct curl_slist ** list, void *userdata);

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_TRAILERFUNCTION,
                          curl_trailer_callback *func);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a callback function.

This callback function is called once right before sending the final CR LF in
an HTTP chunked transfer to fill a list of trailing headers to be sent before
finishing the HTTP transfer.

You can set the userdata argument with the \fICURLOPT_TRAILERDATA(3)\fP
option.

The trailing headers included in the linked list must not be CRLF-terminated,
because libcurl adds the appropriate line termination characters after each
header item.

If you use curl_slist_append to add trailing headers to the curl_slist then
libcurl duplicates the strings, and frees the curl_slist and the duplicates
once the trailers have been sent.

If one of the trailing header fields is not formatted correctly it is ignored
and an info message is emitted.

The return value can either be \fBCURL_TRAILERFUNC_OK\fP or
\fBCURL_TRAILERFUNC_ABORT\fP which would respectively instruct libcurl to
either continue with sending the trailers or to abort the request.

If you set this option to NULL, then the transfer proceeds as usual
without any interruptions.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTP
.SH EXAMPLE
#include <curl/curl.h>

static int trailer_cb(struct curl_slist **tr, void *data)
{
  /* libcurl frees the list */
  *tr = curl_slist_append(*tr, "My-super-awesome-trailer: trailer-stuff");
  return CURL_TRAILERFUNC_OK;
}

CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  /* Set the URL of the request */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  /* Now set it as a put */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PUT, 1L);

  /* Assuming we have a function that returns the data to be pushed
     Let that function be read_cb */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_READFUNCTION, read_cb);

  struct curl_slist *headers = NULL;
  headers = curl_slist_append(headers, "Trailer: My-super-awesome-trailer");
  res = curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, headers);

  /* Set the trailers filling callback */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_TRAILERFUNCTION, trailer_cb);

  /* Perform the transfer */
  res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

  curl_slist_free_all(headers);
}
.SH AVAILABILITY
This option was added in curl 7.64.0 and is present if HTTP support is enabled
