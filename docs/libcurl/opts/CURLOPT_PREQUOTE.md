# NAME

CURLOPT_PREQUOTE - commands to run before an FTP transfer

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE,
                          struct curl_slist *cmds);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to pass to the server after
the transfer type is set. The linked list should be a fully valid list of
struct curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
CURLOPT_QUOTE(3).

Using this option multiple times makes the last set string override the
previous ones. Set it to NULL to disable its use again.

libcurl does not copy the list, it needs to be kept around until after the
transfer has completed.

While CURLOPT_QUOTE(3) and CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE(3) work for SFTP,
this option does not.

# DEFAULT

NULL

# %PROTOCOLS%

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  struct curl_slist *cmdlist = NULL;
  cmdlist = curl_slist_append(cmdlist, "SYST");

  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/foo.bin");

    /* pass in the FTP commands to run */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE, cmdlist);

    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
  }
  curl_slist_free_all(cmdlist);
}
~~~

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

curl_easy_setopt(3) returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3).
