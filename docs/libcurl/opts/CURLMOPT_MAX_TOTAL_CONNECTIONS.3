.TH CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS 3 "4 Nov 2014" "libcurl 7.39.0" "curl_multi_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS \- max simultaneously open connections
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLMcode curl_multi_setopt(CURLM *handle, CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS, long amount);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a long for the \fBamount\fP. The set number will be used as the maximum
number of simultaneously open connections in total using this multi
handle. For each new session, libcurl will open a new connection up to the
limit set by \fICURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS(3)\fP. When the limit is
reached, the sessions will be pending until there are available
connections. If \fICURLMOPT_PIPELINING(3)\fP is enabled, libcurl will try to
pipeline or use multiplexing if the host is capable of it.
.SH DEFAULT
The default value is 0, which means that there is no limit. It is then simply
controlled by the number of easy handles added.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURLM *m = curl_multi_init();
/* never do more than 15 connections */
curl_multi_setopt(m, CURLMOPT_MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS, 15L);
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.30.0
