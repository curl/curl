# NAME

CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION - SSL context callback

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode ssl_ctx_callback(CURL *curl, void *ssl_ctx, void *clientp);

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION,
                          ssl_ctx_callback);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the prototype
shown above.

This callback function gets called by libcurl just before the initialization
of an SSL connection after having processed all other SSL related options to
give a last chance to an application to modify the behavior of the SSL
initialization. The *ssl_ctx* parameter is a pointer to the SSL library's
*SSL_CTX* for OpenSSL or wolfSSL, a pointer to *mbedtls_ssl_config* for
mbedTLS. If an error is returned from the callback no attempt to establish a
connection is made and the perform operation returns the callback's error
code. Set the *clientp* argument passed in to this callback with the
CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_DATA(3) option.

This function gets called for all new connections made to a server, during the
SSL negotiation. While *ssl_ctx* points to a newly initialized object each
time, the pointer may still be the same as in a prior call.

To use this callback, a non-trivial amount of knowledge of your SSL library is
necessary. For example, you can use this function to call library-specific
callbacks to add additional validation code for certificates, and even to
change the actual URI of an HTTPS request.

For OpenSSL, asynchronous certificate verification via *SSL_set_retry_verify*
is supported. (Added in 8.3.0)

The CURLOPT_SSL_CTX_FUNCTION(3) callback allows the application to reach in
and modify SSL details in the connection without libcurl itself knowing
anything about it, which then subsequently can lead to libcurl unknowingly
reusing SSL connections with different properties. To remedy this you may set
CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE(3) from the callback function.

If you are using DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) via CURLOPT_DOH_URL(3) then this
callback is also called for those transfers and the curl handle is set to an
internal handle. **This behavior is subject to change.** We recommend setting
CURLOPT_PRIVATE(3) on your curl handle so you can identify it correctly in the
context callback. If you have a reason to modify DoH SSL context please let us
know on the curl-library mailing list because we are considering removing this
capability.

libcurl does not guarantee the lifetime of the passed in object once this
callback function has returned. Your application must not assume that it can
keep using the SSL context or data derived from it once this function is
completed.

For libcurl builds using TLS backends that support CA caching and
CURLOPT_CA_CACHE_TIMEOUT(3) is not set to zero, multiple calls to this
callback may be done with the same CA store in memory.
