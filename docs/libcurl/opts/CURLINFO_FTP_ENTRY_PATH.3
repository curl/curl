.TH CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH 3 "12 Sep 2015" "libcurl 7.44.0" "curl_easy_getinfo options"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH \- get entry path in FTP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH, char **path);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive a pointer to a string holding the
path of the entry path. That is the initial path libcurl ended up in when
logging on to the remote FTP server. This stores a NULL as pointer if
something is wrong.

The \fBpath\fP pointer will be NULL or pointing to private memory you MUST NOT
free - it gets freed when you call \fIcurl_easy_cleanup(3)\fP on the
corresponding CURL handle.
