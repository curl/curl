.TH CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4 3 "03 Jun 2020" "libcurl 7.75.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4 \- V4 signature
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4, char *param);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Provides AWS V4 signature authentication on HTTP(S) header.
.PP
Pass a char * that is the collection of specific arguments are used for
creating outgoing authentication headers.
The format of the param option is:
.IP provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]
.IP provider1,\ provider2
The providers arguments are used for generating some authentication parameters
such as "Algorithm", "date", "request type" and "signed headers".
.IP region
The argument is a geographic area of a resources collection.
It is extracted from the host name specified in the URL if omitted.
.IP service
The argument is a function provided by a cloud.
It is extracted from the host name specified in the URL if omitted.
.PP
NOTE: This call set \fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)\fP to CURLAUTH_AWS_SIGV4.
Calling \fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)\fP with CURLAUTH_AWS_SIGV4 is the same
as calling this with "aws:amz" in parameter.
.PP
Example with "Test:Try", when curl will do the algorithm, it will generate
"TEST-HMAC-SHA256" for "Algorithm", "x-try-date" and "X-Try-Date" for "date",
"test4_request" for "request type",
"SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-try-date" for "signed headers"
.PP
If you use just "test", instead of "test:try",
test will be use for every strings generated
.SH DEFAULT
By default, the value of this parameter is NULL.
Calling \fICURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)\fP with CURLAUTH_AWS_SIGV4 is the same
as calling this with "aws:amz" in parameter.

  /* service and region also could be set in CURLOPT_AWS_SIGV4 */
  /*
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/uri");
