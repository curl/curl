.TH CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID 3 "19 Jun 2014" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID \- RTSP session ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID, char *id);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * as a parameter to set the value of the current RTSP Session ID
for the handle. Useful for resuming an in-progress session. Once this value is
set to any non-NULL value, libcurl will return \fICURLE_RTSP_SESSION_ERROR\fP
if ID received from the server does not match. If unset (or set to NULL),
libcurl will automatically set the ID the first time the server sets it in a
response.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
