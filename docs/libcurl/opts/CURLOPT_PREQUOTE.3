.TH CURLOPT_PREQUOTE 3 "17 Jun 2014" "libcurl 7.37.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_PREQUOTE \- commands to run before an FTP transfer
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE,
                          struct curl_slist *cmds);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a linked list of FTP commands to pass to the server after
the transfer type is set. The linked list should be a fully valid list of
struct curl_slist structs properly filled in as described for
\fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP. Disable this operation again by setting a NULL to this
option.

While \fICURLOPT_QUOTE(3)\fP and \fICURLOPT_POSTQUOTE(3)\fP work for SFTP,
this option does not.

NULL

struct curl_slist *cmdlist = NULL;
cmdlist = curl_slist_append(cmdlist, "SYST");

if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "ftp://example.com/foo.bin");

  /* pass in the FTP commands to run */
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_PREQUOTE, cmdlist);

  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
