.TH CURLOPT_ESNI_ASCIIRR 3 "2 Jul 2019" "libcurl FUTURE" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_ESNI_ASCIIRR \- specify the public key data to use for ESNI
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_ESNI_ASCIIRR, char *blob);
.fi
.SH EXPERIMENTAL
Warning: this feature is early code and is marked as experimental. It can only
be enabled by explicitly telling configure with \fB--enable-esni\fP. You are
advised to not ship this in production before the experimental label is
removed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass in a pointer to a string representing, in base64 or hexadecimal
encoding, one or more ESNI public key data structures to be used for
authenticating the TLS connection.  For ESNI processing, these data
are REQUIRED, and must either be specified using this option, or
fetched automatically from the DNS by a query to the service
identified by CURLOPT_DOH_URL.

Multiple ESNI public key data structures may be specified using
hexadecimal encoding by simply concatenating the individual encoded
strings, or using base-64 encoding by using a semicolon between each
individual encoded string and the following one.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL. No key data are specified.
.SH PROTOCOLS
HTTPS
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_ESNI_STATUS, 1L);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_ESNI_COVER, "esni-cover.example.net");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_ESNI_ASCIIRR, ascii_encoded_rrset_blob);
  curl_easy_perform(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
To be added in a FUTURE release
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, and CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not.
