# NAME

CURLOPT_SHARE - share handle to use

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SHARE, CURLSH *share);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Pass a *share* handle as a parameter. The share handle must have been created
by a previous call to curl_share_init(3). Setting this option, makes this curl
handle use the data from the shared handle instead of keeping the data to
itself. This enables several curl handles to share data. If the curl handles
are used simultaneously in multiple threads, you **must** use the locking
methods in the share handle. See curl_share_setopt(3) for details.

If you add a share that is set to share cookies, your easy handle uses that
cookie cache and get the cookie engine enabled. If you stop sharing an object
that was using cookies (or change to another object that does not share
cookies), the easy handle gets its cookie engine disabled.

Data that the share object is not set to share is dealt with the usual way, as
if no share was used.

Set this option to NULL again to stop using that share object.

# DEFAULT

NULL

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  CURL *curl2 = curl_easy_init(); /* a second handle */
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    CURLSH *shobject = curl_share_init();
    curl_share_setopt(shobject, CURLSHOPT_SHARE, CURL_LOCK_DATA_COOKIE);

    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SHARE, shobject);
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

    /* the second handle shares cookies from the first */
    curl_easy_setopt(curl2, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/second");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl2, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "");
    curl_easy_setopt(curl2, CURLOPT_SHARE, shobject);
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl2);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl2);

    curl_share_cleanup(shobject);
  }
}
