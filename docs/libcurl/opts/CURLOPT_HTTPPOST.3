.TH CURLOPT_HTTPPOST 3 "17 Jun 2014" libcurl libcurl
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_HTTPPOST \- multipart formpost content
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_HTTPPOST,
                          struct curl_httppost *formpost);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBThis option is deprecated.\fP Use \fICURLOPT_MIMEPOST(3)\fP instead.

Tells libcurl you want a \fBmultipart/formdata\fP HTTP POST to be made and you
instruct what data to pass on to the server in the \fIformpost\fP argument.
Pass a pointer to a linked list of \fIcurl_httppost\fP structs as parameter.
The easiest way to create such a list, is to use \fIcurl_formadd(3)\fP as
documented. The data in this list must remain intact as long as the curl
transfer is alive and is using it.

Using POST with HTTP 1.1 implies the use of a "Expect: 100-continue" header.
You can disable this header with \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP.

When setting \fICURLOPT_HTTPPOST(3)\fP, it will automatically set
\fICURLOPT_NOBODY(3)\fP to 0.
.SH DEFAULT
NULL
