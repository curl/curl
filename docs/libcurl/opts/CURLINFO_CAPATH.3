.TH CURLINFO_CAPATH 3 "20 May 2022" "libcurl" "libcurl"
.SH NAME
CURLINFO_CAPATH \- get the default built-in CA path string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *handle, CURLINFO_CAPATH, char **path);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a pointer to a char pointer to receive the pointer to a null-terminated
string holding the default built-in path used for the \fICURLOPT_CAPATH(3)\fP
option unless set by the user.

Note that in a situation where libcurl has been built to support multiple TLS
libraries, this option might return a string even if the specific TLS library
currently set to be used does not support \fICURLOPT_CAPATH(3)\fP.

This is a path identifying a directory.

The \fBpath\fP pointer will be NULL if there is no default path.
