# NAME

curl_version_info - returns runtime libcurl version info

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

curl_version_info_data *curl_version_info(CURLversion age);
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Returns a pointer to a filled in static struct with information about various
features in the running version of libcurl. *age* should be set to the
version of this functionality by the time you write your program. This way,
libcurl always returns a proper struct that your program understands, while
programs in the future might get a different struct. **CURLVERSION_NOW** is
the most recent one for the library you have installed:
~~~c
  data = curl_version_info(CURLVERSION_NOW);
~~~
Applications should use this information to judge if things are possible to do
or not, instead of using compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL libraries can be
changed independent of applications.

This function can alter the returned static data as long as
curl_global_init(3) has not been called. It is therefore not thread-safe
before libcurl initialization occurs.

The curl_version_info_data struct looks like this

~~~c
typedef struct {
  CURLversion age;          /* see description below */

  const char *version;      /* human readable string */
  unsigned int version_num; /* numeric representation */

~~~

*age* describes what the age of this struct is. The number depends on how
new the libcurl you are using is. You are however guaranteed to get a struct
that you have a matching struct for in the header, as you tell libcurl your
"age" with the input argument.

*version* is just an ASCII string for the libcurl version.

*version_num* is a 24 bit number created like this: \<8 bits major number\> |
\<8 bits minor number\> | \<8 bits patch number\>. Version 7.9.8 is therefore
returned as 0x070908.

*host* is an ASCII string showing what host information that this libcurl
was built for. As discovered by a configure script or set by the build
environment.

*features* is a bit mask representing available features. It can have none,
one or more bits set. The use of this field is deprecated: use
*feature_names* instead. The feature names description below lists the
associated bits.

*feature_names* is a pointer to an array of string pointers, containing the
names of the features that libcurl supports. The array is terminated by a NULL
entry. See the list of features names below.

*ssl_version* is an ASCII string for the TLS library name + version used. If
libcurl has no SSL support, this is NULL. For example "Schannel", "Secure
Transport" or "OpenSSL/1.1.0g".

*ssl_version_num* is always 0.

*libz_version* is an ASCII string (there is no numerical version). If
libcurl has no libz support, this is NULL.

*protocols* is a pointer to an array of char * pointers, containing the
names protocols that libcurl supports (using lowercase letters). The protocol
names are the same as would be used in URLs. The array is terminated by a NULL
entry.
