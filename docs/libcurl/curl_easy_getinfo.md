# NAME

curl_easy_getinfo - extract information from a curl handle

# SYNOPSIS

~~~c
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_getinfo(CURL *curl, CURLINFO info, ... );
~~~

# DESCRIPTION

Get the *info* kept in the *curl* handle. The third argument **MUST** be
pointing to the specific type of the used option which is documented in each
man page of the *info* option. The data is stored accordingly and can be
relied upon only if this function returns CURLE_OK. Use this function after a
performed transfer if you want to get transfer related data.

You should not free the memory returned by this function unless it is
explicitly mentioned below.

# EXAMPLE

~~~c
int main(void)
{
  CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
  if(curl) {
    CURLcode res;
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://www.example.com/");
    res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

    if(CURLE_OK == res) {

  }
}

# %AVAILABILITY%

# RETURN VALUE

This function returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see
libcurl-errors(3). If CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER(3) was set with curl_easy_setopt(3)
there can be an error message stored in the error buffer when non-zero is
returned.
