/* A multi-threaded example that uses pthreads and fetches 4 remote files at
 * once over HTTPS.
 *
 * Recent versions of OpenSSL and GnuTLS are thread safe by design, assuming
 * support for the underlying OS threading API is built-in. Older revisions
 * of this example demonstrated locking callbacks for the SSL library, which
 * are no longer necessary. An older revision with callbacks can be found at
 * https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/curl-7_88_1/docs/examples/threaded-ssl.c
