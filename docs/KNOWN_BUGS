These are problems known to exist at the time of this release. Feel free to
join in and help us correct one or more of these! Also be sure to check the
changelog of the current development status, as one or more of these problems
may have been fixed since this was written!

35. Both SOCKS5 and SOCKS4 proxy connections are done blocking, which is very
  bad when used with the multi interface.

34. The SOCKS4 connection codes don't properly acknowledge (connect) timeouts.
  Also see #12.

33. Doing multi-pass HTTP authentication on a non-default port does not work.
  This happens because the multi-pass code abuses the redirect following code
  for doing multiple requests, and when we following redirects to an absolute
  URL we must use the newly specified port and not the one specified in the
  original URL. A proper fix to this would need to separate the negotiation
  "redirect" from an actual redirect.

32. (At least on Windows) If libcurl is built with c-ares and there's no DNS
  server configured in the system, the ares_init() call fails and thus
  curl_easy_init() fails as well. This causes weird effects for people who use
  numerical IP addresses only.

31. "curl-config --libs" will include details set in LDFLAGS when configure is
  run that might be needed only for building libcurl. Similarly, it might
  include options that perhaps aren't suitable both for static and dynamic
  linking. Further, curl-config --cflags suffers from the same effects with
  CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS.

30. You need to use -g to the command line tool in order to use RFC2732-style
  IPv6 numerical addresses in URLs.

29. IPv6 URLs with zone ID is not supported.
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fenner-literal-zone-02.txt
  specifies the use of a plus sign instead of a percent when specifying zone
  IDs in URLs to get around the problem of percent signs being
  special. According to the reporter, Firefox deals with the URL _with_ a
  percent letter (which seems like a blatant URL spec violation).

   See http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1371118

26. NTLM authentication using SSPI (on Windows) when (lib)curl is running in
  "system context" will make it use wrong(?) user name - at least when compared
  to what winhttp does. See http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1281867

25. When doing a CONNECT request with curl it doesn't properly handle if the
  proxy closes the connection within the authentication "negotiation phase".
  Like if you do HTTPS or similar over a proxy and you use perhaps
  --proxy-anyauth. There's work in progress on this problem, and a recent
  patch was posted here: http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2005-08/0074.html

23. We don't support SOCKS for IPv6. We don't support FTPS over a SOCKS proxy.
  We don't have any test cases for SOCKS proxy. We probably have even more
  bugs and lack of features when a SOCKS proxy is used. And there seem to be a
  problem with SOCKS when doing FTP: See
  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1371540

22. Sending files to a FTP server using curl on VMS, might lead to curl
  complaining on "unaligned file size" on completion. The problem is related
  to VMS file structures and the perceived file sizes stat() returns. A
  possible fix would involve sending a "STRU VMS" command.
  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1156287
  
21. FTP ASCII transfers do not follow RFC959. They don't convert the data
   accordingly (not for sending nor for receiving). RFC 959 section 3.1.1.1
   clearly describes how this should be done:

     The sender converts the data from an internal character representation to
     the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet
     specification).  The receiver will convert the data from the standard
     form to his own internal form.

   Since 7.15.4 at least line endings are converted.

19. FTP 3rd party transfers with the multi interface doesn't work. Test:
  define CURL_MULTIEASY, rebuild curl, run test case 230 - 232.

16. FTP URLs passed to curl may contain NUL (0x00) in the RFC 1738 <user>,
  <password>, and <fpath> components, encoded as "%00".  The problem is that
  curl_unescape does not detect this, but instead returns a shortened C
  string.  From a strict FTP protocol standpoint, NUL is a valid character
  within RFC 959 <string>, so the way to handle this correctly in curl would
  be to use a data structure other than a plain C string, one that can handle
  embedded NUL characters.  From a practical standpoint, most FTP servers
  would not meaningfully support NUL characters within RFC 959 <string>,
  anyway (e.g., UNIX pathnames may not contain NUL).

14. Test case 165 might fail on system which has libidn present, but with an
  old iconv version (2.1.3 is a known bad version), since it doesn't recognize
  the charset when named ISO8859-1. Changing the name to ISO-8859-1 makes the
  test pass, but instead makes it fail on Solaris hosts that use its native
  iconv.

13. curl version 7.12.2 fails on AIX if compiled with --enable-ares.
  The workaround is to combine --enable-ares with --disable-shared

12. When connecting to a SOCKS proxy, the (connect) timeout is not properly
  acknowledged after the actual TCP connect (during the SOCKS "negotiate"
  phase).

11. Using configure --disable-[protocol] may cause 'make test' to fail for
  tests using the disabled protocol(s).

10. To get HTTP Negotiate authentication to work fine, you need to provide a
  (fake) user name (this concerns both curl and the lib) because the code
  wrongly only considers authentication if there's a user name provided.
  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1004841. How?
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2004-08/0182.html

8. Doing resumed upload over HTTP does not work with '-C -', because curl
  doesn't do a HEAD first to get the initial size. This needs to be done
  manually for HTTP PUT resume to work, and then '-C [index]'.

7. CURLOPT_USERPWD and CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD have no way of providing user names
  that contain a colon. This can't be fixed easily in a backwards compatible
  way without adding new options (and then, they should most probably allow
  setting user name and password separately).

6. libcurl ignores empty path parts in FTP URLs, whereas RFC1738 states that
  such parts should be sent to the server as 'CWD ' (without an argument).
  The only exception to this rule, is that we knowingly break this if the
  empty part is first in the path, as then we use the double slashes to
  indicate that the user wants to reach the root dir (this exception SHALL
  remain even when this bug is fixed).

5. libcurl doesn't treat the content-length of compressed data properly, as
  it seems HTTP servers send the *uncompressed* length in that header and
  libcurl thinks of it as the *compressed* length. Some explanations are here:
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2003-06/0146.html

2. If a HTTP server responds to a HEAD request and includes a body (thus
  violating the RFC2616), curl won't wait to read the response but just stop
  reading and return back. If a second request (let's assume a GET) is then
  immediately made to the same server again, the connection will be re-used
  fine of course, and the second request will be sent off but when the
  response is to get read, the previous response-body is what curl will read
  and havoc is what happens.
  More details on this is found in this libcurl mailing list thread:
