# ENVIRONMENT
The environment variables can be specified in lower case or upper case. The
lower case version has precedence. `http_proxy` is an exception as it is only
available in lower case.

Using an environment variable to set the proxy has the same effect as using
the --proxy option.

## `http_proxy` [protocol://]<host>[:port]
Sets the proxy server to use for HTTP.

## `HTTPS_PROXY` [protocol://]<host>[:port]
Sets the proxy server to use for HTTPS.

## `[url-protocol]_PROXY` [protocol://]<host>[:port]
Sets the proxy server to use for [url-protocol], where the protocol is a
protocol that curl supports and as specified in a URL. FTP, FTPS, POP3, IMAP,
SMTP, LDAP, etc.

## `ALL_PROXY` [protocol://]<host>[:port]
Sets the proxy server to use if no protocol-specific proxy is set.

## `NO_PROXY` <comma-separated list of hosts/domains>
list of hostnames that should not go through any proxy. If set to an asterisk
'*' only, it matches all hosts. Each name in this list is matched as either a
domain name which contains the hostname, or the hostname itself.

This environment variable disables use of the proxy even when specified with
the --proxy option. That is

    NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
    http://direct.example.com

accesses the target URL directly, and

    NO_PROXY=direct.example.com curl -x http://proxy.example.com
    http://somewhere.example.com

accesses the target URL through the proxy.

The list of hostnames can also include numerical IP addresses, and IPv6
versions should then be given without enclosing brackets.

IP addresses can be specified using CIDR notation: an appended slash and
number specifies the number of "network bits" out of the address to use in the
comparison (added in 7.86.0). For example "192.168.0.0/16" would match all
addresses starting with "192.168".

## `APPDATA` <dir>
On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory. If
the primary home variables are all unset.

## `COLUMNS` <terminal width>
If set, the specified number of characters is used as the terminal width when
the alternative progress-bar is shown. If not set, curl tries to figure it out
using other ways.

## `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` <file>
If set, it is used as the --cacert value. This environment variable is ignored
if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.

## `CURL_HOME` <dir>
If set, is the first variable curl checks when trying to find its home
directory. If not set, it continues to check *XDG_CONFIG_HOME*

## `CURL_SSL_BACKEND` <TLS backend>
If curl was built with support for "MultiSSL", meaning that it has built-in
support for more than one TLS backend, this environment variable can be set to
the case insensitive name of the particular backend to use when curl is
invoked. Setting a name that is not a built-in alternative makes curl stay
with the default.

SSL backend names (case-insensitive): **gnutls**, **mbedtls**, **openssl**,
**rustls**, **schannel**, **wolfssl**

## `HOME` <dir>
If set, this is used to find the home directory when that is needed. Like when
looking for the default .curlrc. *CURL_HOME* and *XDG_CONFIG_HOME*
have preference.

## `QLOGDIR` <directory name>
If curl was built with HTTP/3 support, setting this environment variable to a
local directory makes curl produce **qlogs** in that directory, using file
names named after the destination connection id (in hex). Do note that these
files can become rather large. Works with the ngtcp2 and quiche QUIC backends.

## `SHELL`
Used on VMS when trying to detect if using a **DCL** or a **Unix** shell.

## `SSL_CERT_DIR` <dir>
If set, it is used as the --capath value. This environment variable is ignored
if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.

## `SSL_CERT_FILE` <path>
If set, it is used as the --cacert value. This environment variable is ignored
if Schannel is used as the TLS backend.

## `SSLKEYLOGFILE` <filename>
If you set this environment variable to a filename, curl stores TLS secrets
from its connections in that file when invoked to enable you to analyze the
TLS traffic in real time using network analyzing tools such as Wireshark. This
works with the following TLS backends: OpenSSL, LibreSSL (TLS 1.2 max),
BoringSSL, GnuTLS, wolfSSL and Rustls.

## `USERPROFILE` <dir>
On Windows, this variable is used when trying to find the home directory. If
the other, primary, variables are all unset. If set, curl uses the path
**"$USERPROFILE\Application Data"**.

## `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` <dir>
If *CURL_HOME* is not set, this variable is checked when looking for a
default .curlrc file.
