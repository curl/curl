# `--junk-session-cookies`

When curl is told to read cookies from a given file, this option makes it
discard all session cookies. This has the same effect as if a new session is
started. Typical browsers discard session cookies when they are closed down.

Session cookies are cookies without a set expiry time. They are meant to only
last for "a session".
