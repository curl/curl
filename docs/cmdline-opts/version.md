# `--version`

Display information about curl and the libcurl version it uses.

The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl and other 3rd party
libraries linked with the executable.

This line may contain one or more TLS libraries. curl can be built to support
more than one TLS library which then makes curl - at start-up - select which
particular backend to use for this invocation.

If curl supports more than one TLS library like this, the ones that are *not*
selected by default are listed within parentheses. Thus, if you do not specify
which backend to use (with the `CURL_SSL_BACKEND` environment variable) the
one listed without parentheses is used. Such builds also has `MultiSSL` set as
a feature.

The second line (starts with `Release-Date:`) shows the release date.

The third line (starts with `Protocols:`) shows all protocols that libcurl
reports to support.

reports to offer. Available features include:

## `alt-svc`

done using either the c-ares or the threaded resolver backends.

## `brotli`
Support for automatic brotli compression over HTTP(S).

## `CharConv`

and memory debugging etc. For curl-developers only.
