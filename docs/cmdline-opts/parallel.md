# `--parallel`

Make curl perform all transfers in parallel as compared to the regular serial
manner. Parallel transfer means that curl runs up to N concurrent transfers
simultaneously and if there are more than N transfers to handle, it starts new
ones when earlier transfers finish.

With parallel transfers, the progress meter output is different than when
doing serial transfers, as it then displays the transfer status for multiple
transfers in a single line.

The maximum amount of concurrent transfers is set with --parallel-max and it
defaults to 50.
