# `--doh-insecure`

By default, every connection curl makes to a DoH server is verified to be
secure before the transfer takes place. This option tells curl to skip the
verification step and proceed without checking.

**WARNING**: using this option makes the DoH transfer and name resolution
insecure.

This option is equivalent to --insecure and --proxy-insecure but used for DoH
(DNS-over-HTTPS) only.
