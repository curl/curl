# GLOBBING
You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs by writing lists within braces
or ranges within brackets. We call this "globbing".

Provide a list with three different names like this:

    http://site.{one,two,three}.com

Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:

    ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt

With leading zeroes:

    ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt

With letters through the alphabet:

    ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt

Nested sequences are not supported, but you can use several ones next to each
other:

    http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html

You can specify a step counter for the ranges to get every Nth number or
letter:

    http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt

    http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt

When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you
probably have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from
interfering with it. This also goes for other characters treated special, like
for example '&', '?' and '*'.

Switch off globbing with --globoff.
