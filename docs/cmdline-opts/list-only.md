# `--list-only`

When listing an FTP directory, force a name-only view. Maybe particularly
useful if the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP directory
since the normal directory view does not use a standard look or format. When
used like this, the option causes an NLST command to be sent to the server
instead of LIST.

Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response to NLST; they do not
include subdirectories and symbolic links.

When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces a name-only view, one per
line. This is especially useful if the user wants to machine-parse the
contents of an SFTP directory since the normal directory view provides more
information than just filenames.

When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this switch forces a LIST command
to be performed instead of RETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants
to see if a specific message-id exists on the server and what size it is.

For FILE, this option has no effect yet as directories are always listed in
this mode.

Note: When combined with --request, this option can be used to send a UIDL
command instead, so the user may use the email's unique identifier rather than
its message-id to make the request.
