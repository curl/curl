# `--http2-prior-knowledge`

Issue a non-TLS HTTP requests using HTTP/2 directly without HTTP/1.1 Upgrade.
It requires prior knowledge that the server supports HTTP/2 straight away.
HTTPS requests still do HTTP/2 the standard way with negotiated protocol
version in the TLS handshake.

Since 8.10.0 if this option is set for an HTTPS request then the application
layer protocol version (ALPN) offered to the server is only HTTP/2. Prior to
that both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 were offered.
