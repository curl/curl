# `--write-out`

Make curl display information on stdout after a completed transfer. The format
is a string that may contain plain text mixed with any number of variables.
The format can be specified as a literal "string", or you can have curl read
the format from a file with "@filename" and to tell curl to read the format
from stdin you write "@-".

The variables present in the output format are substituted by the value or
text that curl thinks fit, as described below. All variables are specified as
%{variable_name} and to output a normal % you just write them as %%. You can
output a newline by using \n, a carriage return with \r and a tab space with
\t.

The output is by default written to standard output, but can be changed with
%{stderr} and %output{}.

Output HTTP header values from the transfer's most recent server response by
using *%header{name}* where *name* is the case insensitive name of the header
(without the trailing colon). The header contents are exactly as delivered over
the network but with leading and trailing whitespace and newlines stripped off
(added in 7.84.0).

Select a specific target destination file to write the output to, by using
*%output{name}* (added in curl 8.3.0) where *name* is the full filename. The
output following that instruction is then written to that file. More than one
*%output{}* instruction can be specified in the same write-out argument. If
the filename cannot be created, curl leaves the output destination to the one
used prior to the *%output{}* instruction. Use *%output{\>\>name}* to append
data to an existing file.

This output is done independently of if the file transfer was successful or
not.

If the specified action or output specified with this option fails in any way,
it does not make curl return a (different) error.

**NOTE:** On Windows, the %-symbol is a special symbol used to expand
environment variables. In batch files, all occurrences of % must be doubled
when using this option to properly escape. If this option is used at the
command prompt then the % cannot be escaped and unintended expansion is
possible.

The variables available are:

## `certs`
Output the certificate chain with details. Supported only by the OpenSSL,
GnuTLS, Schannel and Rustls backends. (Added in 7.88.0)

## `conn_id`
The connection identifier last used by the transfer. The connection id is
unique number among all connections using the same connection cache.

## `exitcode`
The numerical exit code of the transfer. (Added in 7.75.0)

## `filename_effective`

is told to write to a file with the --remote-name or --output option. It is
most useful in combination with the --remote-header-name option.
(Added in 7.26.0)

## `ftp_entry_path`
The initial path curl ended up in when logging on to the remote FTP
server. (Added in 7.15.4)

## `header{name}`

Unlike other variables, the variable name `header` is not in braces. For
example `%header{date}`. Refer to --write-out remarks. (Added in 7.84.0)

## `header_json`
A JSON object with all HTTP response headers from the recent transfer. Values
are provided as arrays, since in the case of multiple headers there can be
multiple values. (Added in 7.83.0)

The header names provided in lowercase, listed in order of appearance over the
wire. Except for duplicated headers. They are grouped on the first occurrence
of that header, each value is presented in the JSON array.

## `http_code`

FTP(s) transfer.

## `http_connect`

## `json`
A JSON object with all available keys. (Added in 7.70.0)

Number of server certificates received in the TLS handshake. Supported only by
the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Schannel and Rustls backends. (Added in 7.88.0)

## `num_connects`
Number of new connects made in the recent transfer. (Added in 7.12.3)

redirect). Note that the status line IS NOT a header. (Added in 7.73.0)

## `num_redirects`
Number of redirects that were followed in the request. (Added in 7.12.3)

## `num_retries`
Number of retries actually performed when `--retry` has been used.
(Added in 8.9.0)

## `onerror`
The rest of the output is only shown if the transfer returned a non-zero error.
(Added in 7.75.0)

## `output{filename}`
From this point on, the --write-out output is written to the filename specified
in braces. The filename can be prefixed with `>>` to append to the file. Unlike
other variables, the variable name `output` is not in braces. For example
`%output{>>stats.txt}`. Refer to --write-out remarks. (Added in 8.3.0)

## `proxy_ssl_verify_result`
The result of the HTTPS proxy's SSL peer certificate verification that was
requested. 0 means the verification was successful. (Added in 7.52.0)

## `proxy_used`
Returns 1 if the previous transfer used a proxy, otherwise 0. Useful to for
example determine if a `NOPROXY` pattern matched the hostname or not. (Added
in 8.7.0)

## `redirect_url`
When an HTTP request was made without --location to follow redirects (or when
--max-redirs is met), this variable shows the actual URL a redirect
