# `--tls13-ciphers`

Set which cipher suites to use in the connection if it negotiates TLS 1.3. The
list of ciphers suites must specify valid ciphers. Read up on TLS 1.3 cipher
suite details on this URL:

https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.html

This option is used when curl is built to use OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later,
wolfSSL, or mbedTLS 3.6.0 or later.

Before curl 8.10.0 with mbedTLS or wolfSSL, TLS 1.3 cipher suites were set
by using the --ciphers option.
