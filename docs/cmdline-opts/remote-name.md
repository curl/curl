# `--remote-name`

Write output to a local file named like the remote file we get. (Only the file
part of the remote file is used, the path is cut off.)

The file is saved in the current working directory. If you want the file saved
in a different directory, make sure you change the current working directory
before invoking curl with this option or use --output-dir.

The remote filename to use for saving is extracted from the given URL, nothing
else, and if it already exists it is overwritten. If you want the server to be
able to choose the filename refer to --remote-header-name which can be used in
addition to this option. If the server chooses a filename and that name
already exists it is not overwritten.

There is no URL decoding done on the filename. If it has %20 or other URL
encoded parts of the name, they end up as-is as filename.

You may use this option as many times as the number of URLs you have.

Before curl 8.10.0, curl returned an error if the URL ended with a slash,
which means that there is no filename part in the URL. Starting in 8.10.0,
curl sets the filename to the last directory part of the URL or if that also
is missing to `curl_response` (without extension) for this situation.
