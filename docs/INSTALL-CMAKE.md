# Building with CMake

This document describes how to configure, build and install curl and libcurl
from source code using the CMake build tool. To build with CMake, you of
course first have to install CMake. The minimum required version of CMake is
specified in the file `CMakeLists.txt` found in the top of the curl source
tree. Once the correct version of CMake is installed you can follow the
instructions below for the platform you are building on.

CMake builds can be configured either from the command line, or from one of
CMake's GUIs.

# Configuring

A CMake configuration of curl is similar to the autotools build of curl.
It consists of the following steps after you have unpacked the source.

We recommend building with CMake on Windows. For instructions on migrating
from the `projects/Windows` Visual Studio solution files, see
[this section](#migrating-from-visual-studio-ide-project-files). For
instructions on migrating from the winbuild builds, see
[the following section](#migrating-from-winbuild-builds).

## Using `cmake`

You can configure for in source tree builds or for a build tree
that is apart from the source tree.

 - Build in the source tree.

       $ cmake -B .

 - Build in a separate directory (parallel to the curl source tree in this
   example). The build directory is created for you. This is recommended over
   building in the source tree to separate source and build artifacts.

       $ cmake -B ../curl-build

For the full list of CMake build configuration variables see
[the corresponding section](#cmake-build-options).

### Fallback for CMake before version 3.13

CMake before version 3.13 does not support the `-B` option. In that case,
you must create the build directory yourself, `cd` to it and run `cmake`
from there:

    $ mkdir ../curl-build
    $ cd ../curl-build
    $ cmake ../curl

If you want to build in the source tree, it is enough to do this:

    $ cmake .

### Build system generator selection

You can override CMake's default by using `-G <generator-name>`. For example
on Windows with multiple build systems if you have MinGW-w64 then you could use
`-G "MinGW Makefiles"`.
[List of generator names](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

## Using `ccmake`

CMake comes with a curses based interface called `ccmake`. To run `ccmake`
on a curl use the instructions for the command line cmake, but substitute
`ccmake` for `cmake`.

This brings up a curses interface with instructions on the bottom of the
screen. You can press the "c" key to configure the project, and the "g" key to
generate the project. After the project is generated, you can run make.

## Using `cmake-gui`

CMake also comes with a Qt based GUI called `cmake-gui`. To configure with
`cmake-gui`, you run `cmake-gui` and follow these steps:

 1. Fill in the "Where is the source code" combo box with the path to
    the curl source tree.
 2. Fill in the "Where to build the binaries" combo box with the path to
    the directory for your build tree, ideally this should not be the same
    as the source tree, but a parallel directory called curl-build or
    something similar.
 3. Once the source and binary directories are specified, press the
    "Configure" button.
 4. Select the native build tool that you want to use.
 5. At this point you can change any of the options presented in the GUI.
    Once you have selected all the options you want, click the "Generate"
    button.

# Building

Build (you have to specify the build directory).

    $ cmake --build ../curl-build

## Static builds

The CMake build setup is primarily done to work with shared/dynamic third
party dependencies. When linking with shared libraries, the dependency "chain"
is handled automatically by the library loader - on all modern systems.

If you instead link with a static library, you need to provide all the
dependency libraries already at the link command line.

Figuring out all the dependency libraries for a given library is hard, as it
might involve figuring out the dependencies of the dependencies and they vary
between platforms and can change between versions.

When using static dependencies, the build scripts mostly assume that you, the
user, provide all the necessary additional dependency libraries as additional
arguments in the build.

Building statically is not for the faint of heart.

### Fallback for CMake before version 3.13

CMake before version 3.13 does not support the `--build` option. In that
case, you have to `cd` to the build directory and use the building tool that
corresponds to the build files that CMake generated for you. This example
assumes that CMake generates `Makefile`:

    $ cd ../curl-build
    $ make

# Testing

(The test suite does not yet work with the cmake build)

# Installing

Install to default location (you have to specify the build directory).

    $ cmake --install ../curl-build

Do not use `--prefix` to change the installation prefix as the output produced
by the `curl-config` script is determined at CMake configure time. If you want
to set a custom install prefix for curl, set
[`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html)
when configuring the CMake build.

### Fallback for CMake before version 3.15

CMake before version 3.15 does not support the `--install` option. In that
case, you have to `cd` to the build directory and use the building tool that
corresponds to the build files that CMake generated for you. This example
assumes that CMake generates `Makefile`:

    $ cd ../curl-build
    $ make install

# CMake usage

Just as curl can be built and installed using CMake, it can also be used from
CMake.

## Using `find_package`

To locate libcurl from CMake, one can use the standard
[`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)
command in the typical fashion:

```cmake
find_package(CURL 8.12.0 REQUIRED)  # FATAL_ERROR if CURL is not found
```

This invokes the CMake-provided
[FindCURL](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCURL.html) find module,
which first performs a search using the `find_package`
[config mode](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#config-mode-search-procedure).
This is supported by the `CURLConfig.cmake` CMake config script which is
available if the given CURL was built and installed using CMake.

### Detecting CURL features/protocols

Since version 8.12.0, `CURLConfig.cmake` publishes the supported CURL features
and protocols (see [release notes](https://curl.se/ch/8.12.0.html)). These can
be specified using the `find_package` keywords `COMPONENTS` and
`OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`, with protocols in all caps, e.g. `HTTPS`, `LDAP`, while
features should be in their original sentence case, e.g. `AsynchDNS`,
`UnixSockets`. If any of the `COMPONENTS` are missing, then CURL is considered
as *not* found.

Here is an example of using `COMPONENTS` and `OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS` in
`find_package` with CURL:

```cmake
# CURL_FOUND is FALSE if no HTTPS but brotli and zstd can be missing
find_package(CURL 8.12.0 COMPONENTS HTTPS OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS brotli zstd)
```

One can also check the defined `CURL_SUPPORTS_<feature-or-protocol>` variables
if a particular feature/protocol is supported. For example:

```cmake
# check HTTPS
if(CURL_SUPPORTS_HTTPS)
  message(STATUS "CURL supports HTTPS")
else()
  message(STATUS "CURL does NOT support HTTPS")
endif()
```

### Linking against libcurl

To link a CMake target against libcurl one can use
[`target_link_libraries`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html)
as usual:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE CURL::libcurl)
```

# Migrating from Visual Studio IDE Project Files

We recommend using CMake to build curl with MSVC.

The project build files reside in project/Windows/VC\* for VS2010, VS2010 and
VS2013 respectively.

These CMake Visual Studio generators require CMake v3.24 or older. You can
download them from <https://cmake.org/files/v3.24/>.

You can also use `-G "NMake Makefiles"`, which is supported by all CMake
versions.

Configuration element             | Equivalent CMake options
:-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------
`VC10`                            | `-G "Visual Studio 10 2010"`
`VC11`                            | `-G "Visual Studio 11 2012"`
`VC12`                            | `-G "Visual Studio 12 2013"`
`x64`                             | `-A x64`
`Win32`                           | `-A Win32`
`DLL`                             | `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`, `BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=OFF`, (default)
`LIB`                             | `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`, `BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON`
`Debug`                           | `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (`-G "NMake Makefiles"` only)
`Release`                         | `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` (`-G "NMake Makefiles"` only)
`DLL Windows SSPI`                | `CURL_USE_SCHANNEL=ON` (with SSPI enabled by default)
`DLL OpenSSL`                     | `CURL_USE_OPENSSL=ON`, optional: `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`, `OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON`
`DLL libssh2`                     | `CURL_USE_LIBSSH2=ON`, optional: `LIBSSH2_INCLUDE_DIR`, `LIBSSH2_LIBRARY`
`DLL WinIDN`                      | `USE_WIN32_IDN=ON`

For example these commands:

    > cd projects
    > ./generate.bat VC12
    > msbuild "-property:Configuration=DLL Debug - DLL Windows SSPI - DLL WinIDN" Windows/VC12/curl-all.sln

translate to:

    > cmake . -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -A x64 -DCURL_USE_SCHANNEL=ON -DUSE_WIN32_IDN=ON -DCURL_USE_LIBPSL=OFF
    > cmake --build . --config Debug --parallel

We do *not* specify `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` here as we might do for the
`"NMake Makefiles"` generator because the Visual Studio generators are
[multi-config generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_gbl/GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG.html)
and therefore ignore the value of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.

# Migrating from winbuild builds

We recommend CMake to build curl with MSVC. The winbuild build method is
deprecated and may be dropped in a future release.

In CMake you can customize the path of dependencies by passing the absolute
header path and the full path of the library via `*_INCLUDE_DIR` and
`*_LIBRARY` options (see the complete list in the option listing above).
The full path to the library can point to a static library or an import
library, which defines if the dependency is linked as a dll or statically.
For OpenSSL this works
[differently](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindOpenSSL.html):
You can pass the root directory of the OpenSSL installation via
`OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`, then pass `OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON` to select static
libs.

`MACHINE`: `x64`, `x86`           | `-A x64`, `-A Win32`
`MODE`: `dll`, `static`           | `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON/OFF`, `BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON/OFF`, `BUILD_STATIC_CURL=ON/OFF` (default: dll)
`RTLIBCFG`: `static`              | `CURL_STATIC_CRT=ON`

`WITH_CARES`, `CARES_PATH`        | `ENABLE_ARES=ON`, optional: `CARES_INCLUDE_DIR`, `CARES_LIBRARY`
`WITH_MBEDTLS`, `MBEDTLS_PATH`    | `CURL_USE_MBEDTLS=ON`, optional: `MBEDTLS_INCLUDE_DIR`, `MBEDTLS_LIBRARY`, `MBEDX509_LIBRARY`, `MBEDCRYPTO_LIBRARY`
`WITH_MSH3`, `MSH_PATH`           | `USE_MSH3=ON`, optional: `MSH3_INCLUDE_DIR`, `MSH3_LIBRARY`

`WITH_ZLIB`, `ZLIB_PATH`          | `CURL_ZLIB=ON`, optional: `ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR`, `ZLIB_LIBRARY`

For example this command-line:

    > nmake -f Makefile.vc VC=17 MACHINE=x64 DEBUG=ON mode=dll SSL_PATH=C:\OpenSSL WITH_SSL=dll ENABLE_UNICODE=ON

translates to:

    > cmake . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=C:\OpenSSL -DCURL_USE_OPENSSL=ON -DENABLE_UNICODE=ON -DCURL_USE_LIBPSL=OFF
    > cmake --build . --config Debug

We use `--config` with `cmake --build` because the Visual Studio CMake
generators are multi-config and therefore ignore `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`.
