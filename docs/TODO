TODO

 Things to do in project cURL. Please tell us what you think, contribute and
 send us patches that improve things! Also check the http://curl.haxx.se/dev
 web section for various technical development notes.

 LIBCURL

 * Introduce an interface to libcurl that allows applications to easier get to
   know what cookies that are received. Pushing interface that calls a
   callback on each received cookie? Querying interface that asks about
   existing cookies? We probably need both. Enable applications to modify
   existing cookies as well.

 * Make content encoding/decoding internally be made using a filter system.

 * Introduce another callback interface for upload/download that makes one
   less copy of data and thus a faster operation.
   [http://curl.haxx.se/dev/no_copy_callbacks.txt]

 * Add asynchronous name resolving (http://libdenise.sf.net/). This should be
   made to work on most of the supported platforms, or otherwise it isn't
   really interesting.

 * Data sharing. Tell which easy handles within a multi handle that should
   share cookies, connection cache, dns cache, ssl session cache.  Full
   suggestion found here: http://curl.haxx.se/dev/sharing.txt

 * Mutexes. By adding mutex callback support, the 'data sharing' mentioned
   above can be made between several easy handles running in different threads
   too. The actual mutex implementations will be left for the application to
   implement, libcurl will merely call 'getmutex' and 'leavemutex' callbacks.
   Part of the sharing suggestion at: http://curl.haxx.se/dev/sharing.txt

 * Set the SO_KEEPALIVE socket option to make libcurl notice and disconnect
   very long time idle connections.

 * Go through the code and verify that libcurl deals with big files >2GB and
   >4GB all over. Bug reports (and source reviews) indicate that it doesn't
   currently work properly.

 * CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE. Prevent downloads that are larger than the specified
   size. CURLE_FILESIZE_EXCEEDED would then be returned. Gautam Mani
   requested. That is, the download should not even begin but be aborted
   immediately.

 * Allow the http_proxy (and other) environment variables to contain user and
   password as well in the style: http://proxyuser:proxypasswd@proxy:port
   Berend Reitsma suggested.

 LIBCURL - multi interface

 * Make sure we don't ever loop because of non-blocking sockets return
   EWOULDBLOCK or similar. This FTP command sending, the SSL connection etc.

 * Make transfers treated more carefully. We need a way to tell libcurl we
   have data to write, as the current system expects us to upload data each
   time the socket is writable and there is no way to say that we want to
   upload data soon just not right now, without that aborting the upload. The
   opposite situation should be possible as well, that we tell libcurl we're
   ready to accept read data. Today libcurl feeds the data as soon as it is
   available for reading, no matter what.

 DOCUMENTATION

 * More and better

 FTP

 * FTP ASCII upload does not follow RFC959 section 3.1.1.1: "The sender
   converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard
   8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification).  The
   receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal
   form."

 * Since USERPWD always override the user and password specified in URLs, we
   might need another way to specify user+password for anonymous ftp logins.

 * An option to only download remote FTP files if they're newer than the local
   one is a good idea, and it would fit right into the same syntax as the
   already working http dito works (-z). It of course requires that 'MDTM'
   works, and it isn't a standard FTP command.

 * Add FTPS support with SSL for the data connection too.  This should be made
   according to the specs written in draft-murray-auth-ftp-ssl-08.txt,
   "Securing FTP with TLS"

 * --disable-epsv exists, but for active connections we have no --disable-eprt
   (or even --disable-lprt).

 HTTP

 * If the "body" of the POST is < MSS it really aught to be sent along with
   the headers. More generally, if the last chunk of the POST body is < MSS,
   it should be sent with the previous chunk (which may be the POST headers).
   So long as any one send is larger than MSS (or there is only one send when
   < MSS :), the Nagle Algorithm will not be a problem on any stack where
   Nagle is implemented correctly. (pointed out by Rick Jones)

 * Authentication: NTLM. Support for that MS crap called NTLM
   authentication. MS proxies and servers sometime require that. Since that
   protocol is a proprietary one, it involves reverse engineering and network
   sniffing. This should however be a library-based functionality. There are a
   few different efforts "out there" to make open source HTTP clients support
   this and it should be possible to take advantage of other people's hard
   work. http://modntlm.sourceforge.net/ is one. There's a web page at
   http://www.innovation.ch/java/ntlm.html that contains detailed reverse-
   engineered info.

 * RFC2617 compliance, "Digest Access Authentication" A valid test page seem
   to exist at: http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/testpage/digest/ And some friendly
   person's server source code is available at
   http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/digestauth/index.html Then there's the Apache
   mod_digest source code too of course.  It seems as if Netscape doesn't
   support this, and not many servers do. Although this is a lot better
   authentication method than the more common "Basic". Basic sends the
   password in cleartext over the network, this "Digest" method uses a
   challange-response protocol which increases security quite a lot.

 * Pipelining. Sending multiple requests before the previous one(s) are done.
   This could possibly be implemented using the multi interface to queue
   requests and the response data.

 TELNET

 * Make TELNET work on windows98!

 * Reading input (to send to the remote server) on stdin is a crappy solution
   for library purposes. We need to invent a good way for the application to
   be able to provide the data to send.

 * Move the telnet support's network select() loop go away and merge the code
   into the main transfer loop. Until this is done, the multi interface won't
   work for telnet.

 SSL

 * If you really want to improve the SSL situation, you should probably have a
   look at SSL cafile loading as well - quick traces look to me like these are
   done on every request as well, when they should only be necessary once per
   ssl context (or once per handle). Even better would be to support the SSL
   CAdir option - instead of loading all of the root CA certs for every
   request, this option allows you to only read the CA chain that is actually
   required (into the cache)...

 * Add an interface to libcurl that enables "session IDs" to get
   exported/imported. Cris Bailiff said: "OpenSSL has functions which can
   serialise the current SSL state to a buffer of your choice, and
   recover/reset the state from such a buffer at a later date - this is used
   by mod_ssl for apache to implement and SSL session ID cache". This whole
   idea might become moot if we enable the 'data sharing' as mentioned in the
   LIBCURL label above.

 * OpenSSL supports a callback for customised verification of the peer
   certificate, but this doesn't seem to be exposed in the libcurl APIs. Could
   it be? There's so much that could be done if it were! (brought by Chris
   Clark)

 * Make curl's SSL layer option capable of using other free SSL libraries.
   Such as the Mozilla Security Services
   (http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/) and GNUTLS
   (http://gnutls.hellug.gr/)

 LDAP

 * Look over the implementation. The looping will have to "go away" from the
   lib/ldap.c source file and get moved to the main network code so that the
   multi interface and friends will work for LDAP as well.

 CLIENT

 * Add an option that prevents cURL from overwiting existing local files. When
   used, and there already is an existing file with the target file name
   (either -O or -o), a number should be appended (and increased if already
   existing). So that index.html becomes first index.html.1 and then
   index.html.2 etc. Jeff Pohlmeyer suggested.

 * "curl ftp://site.com/*.txt"

 * Several URLs can be specified to get downloaded. We should be able to use
   the same syntax to specify several files to get uploaded (using the same
   persistant connection), using -T.

 * When the multi interface has been implemented and proved to work, the
   client could be told to use maximum N simultaneous transfers and then just
   make sure that happens. It should of course not make more than one
   connection to the same remote host.

 * Extending the capabilities of the multipart formposting. How about leaving
   the ';type=foo' syntax as it is and adding an extra tag (headers) which
   works like this: curl -F "coolfiles=@fil1.txt;headers=@fil1.hdr" where
   fil1.hdr contains extra headers like

     Content-Type: text/plain; charset=KOI8-R"
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
     X-User-Comment: Please don't use browser specific HTML code

   which should overwrite the program reasonable defaults (plain/text,
   8bit...) (Idea brough to us by kromJx)

 TEST SUITE

 * If perl wasn't found by the configure script, don't attempt to run the
   tests but explain something nice why it doesn't.

 * Extend the test suite to include more protocols. The telnet could just do
   ftp or http operations (for which we have test servers).

 * Make the test suite work on more platforms. OpenBSD and Mac OS. Remove
   fork()s and it should become even more portable.

 * Introduce a test suite that tests libcurl better and more explicitly.

NEXT MAJOR RELEASE

 * curl_easy_cleanup() returns void, but curl_multi_cleanup() returns a
   CURLMcode. These should be changed to be the same.

 * curl_formparse() should be removed
