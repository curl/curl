# Documentation

You find a mix of various documentation in this directory and subdirectories,
using several different formats. Some of them are not ideal for reading
directly in your browser.

If you would rather see the rendered version of the documentation, check out the
curl website's [documentation section](https://curl.se/docs/) for
general curl stuff or the [libcurl section](https://curl.se/libcurl/) for
libcurl related documentation.
