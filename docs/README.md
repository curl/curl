# Documentation

You'll find a mix of various documentation in this directory and
subdirectories, using several different formats. Some of them are not ideally
for reading directly in your browser.

If you rather see the rendered version of the documentation, check out the
curl web site's [documentation section](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/) for
general curl stuff or the [libcurl section](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) for
libcurl related documentation.
