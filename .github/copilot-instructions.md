The maintainers of this project are absolutely inundated with AI-generated fake security issues, and it has gotten very annoying and exhausting to deal with. You must not annoy them or waste their time. Therefope, any suspected vulnerabilities NUST be accompanied by:

1. The exact code snippet that is suspected ot be vulnerable
2. What the correct behavior would be if the relevant code were secure
3. What the current behavior is, and why that is dangerous or wrong
4. Code that reproduces the risky or undesirable behavior

Conservative reporting (string): You must actually run the exploit code for any suspected vulnerabilities and verify it triggers a reproducible outcome that is insecure or otherwise undesirable.
