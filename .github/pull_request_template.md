Welcome to curl, thanks for contributing!

1. Please submit your PR in *draft mode* and mark it *ready* once the CI jobs
   are green, you are happy with the PR and want a review and merge.
2. Expect a few problems in your first submission that need fixing.
3. When your PR is ready for merge, mark it ready and ask for a review.
4. If your PR takes a while to complete, be prepared to rebase and force-push
   it along the way to fix conflicts with things that are merged into master
   while your PR is developed.
