# What to call the final executable
TARGET = example

# Which object files that the executable consists of
OBJS= ftpget.o

# What compiler to use
CC = gcc

# Compiler flags, -g for debug, -c to make an object file
CFLAGS = -c -g

# This should point to a directory that holds libcurl, if it isn't
# in the system's standard lib dir
# We also set a -L to include the directory where we have the openssl
# libraries
LDFLAGS = -L/home/dast/lib -L/usr/local/ssl/lib

# We need -lcurl for the curl stuff
# We need -lsocket and -lnsl when on Solaris
# We need -lssl and -lcrypto when using libcurl with SSL support
# We need -lpthread for the pthread example
LIBS = -lcurl -lsocket -lnsl -lssl -lcrypto
