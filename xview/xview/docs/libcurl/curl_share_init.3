.TH curl_share_init 3 "8 Aug 2003" "libcurl 7.10.7" "libcurl Manual"
.SH NAME
curl_share_init - Create a shared object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <curl/curl.h>
.sp
.BI "CURLSH *curl_share_init( );"
.ad
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a CURLSH handle to be used as input to all the other
share-functions, sometimes referred to as a share handle in some places in the
documentation. This init call MUST have a corresponding call to
\fIcurl_share_cleanup\fP when all operations using the share are complete.

This \fIshare handle\fP is what you pass to curl using the
\fICURLOPT_SHARE(3)\fP option with \fIcurl_easy_setopt(3)\fP, to make that
specific curl handle use the data in this share.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If this function returns NULL, something went wrong (out of memory, etc.)
and therefore the share object was not created.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR curl_share_cleanup "(3), " curl_share_setopt "(3)"
