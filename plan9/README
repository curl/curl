Prerequirement
==============
This document describes how to compile, build and install curl and libcurl
from sources using mk. To build it, you will require to install latest
9legacy patches into Plan 9. Also Plan 9 still have no configuration option so
both zlib and libopenssl are required too.

The zlib that is available on Plan 9 can be downloaded from:

  https://github.com/madler/zlib/pull/398

LibreSSL Portable can be downloaded from:

  https://github.com/libressl/portable/pull/510

Instruction
===========
First, you should construct namespace as like described below:

% bind -ac ../lib lib
% bind -ac ../src src
% bind -ac ../include include
% bind -ac .. .

Then you will see as shown below (excerpt):

  curl.git/
   |_plan9
   | |_BUILD.PLAN9.txt
   | |_CHANGES
   | |_CMake
   | |  :
   | |_mkfile
   | |_mkfile.proto
   | |_include
   | | |_Makefile.am
   | | |  :
   | | |_mkfile
   | |_lib
   | | |_CMakeLists.txt
   | | |  :
   | | |_mkfile
   | | |_mkfile.inc
   | |_src
   | | |_CMakeLists.txt
   | | |  :
   | | |_mkfile
   | | |_mkfile.inc
   |_lib
   |_src

After constructing namespace, you can run mk on plan9 directory.

% mk
% mk install
