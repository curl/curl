Version 5.3a (win32 only)

 Troy Engel
 - Corrected a win32 bug in the environment variable part.

Version 5.3

 Gilbert Ramirez Jr. (21 Dec 1998)
 - I have implemented the "quote" function of FTP clients. It allows you to
   send arbitrary commands to the remote FTP server. I chose the -Q/--quote
   command-line arguments.

   You can have more than one quoted string, and curl will apply them in
   order.  This is what I use for my MVS upload:

  curl -B --crlf -Q "site lrecl=80" -Q "site blk=8000" -T file ftp://os390/test

   Curl will send the two quoted "site" commands in the proper order.

 - Made it compile smoothly on AIX.

 Gilbert Ramirez Jr. (18 Dec 1998)
 - Brought an MVS patch: -3/--mvs, for ftp upload to the MVS ftp server.

 Troy Engel (17 Dec 1998)
 - Brought a correction that fixes the win32 curl bug.

 Daniel Stenberg
 - A bug, pointed out to me by Dr H. T. Leung, caused curl to crash on the -A
   flag on certain systems. Actually, all systems should've!

 - Added a few defines to make directories/file names get build nicer (with _
   instead of . and \ instead of / in win32).

 - steve <fisk at polar.bowdoin.edu> reported a weird bug that occured if the
   ftp server response line had a parenthesis on the line before the (size)
   info. I hope it works better now!

Version 5.2.1

 Steven G. Johnson (Dec 14, 1998)
 - Brought a fix that corrected a crash in 5.2 due to bad treatment of the
   environment variables.

Version 5.2

 Daniel Stenberg (Dec 14, 1998)
 - Rewrote the mkhelp script and now, the mkhelp.pl script generates the
   hugehelp.c file from the README *and* the man page file curl.1. By using
   both files, I no longer need to have double information in both the man
   page and the README as well. So, win32-users will only have the hugehelp.c
   file for all info, but then, they download the plain binary most times
   anyway.

 - gcc2.8.1 with the -Wall flag complaints a lot on subscript has type `char'
   if I don't explicitly typecast the argument to isdigit() or isspace() to
   int. So I did to compile warning free with that too.

 - Added checks for 'long double' and 'long long' in the configure script. I
   need those for the mprintf.c source to compile well on non long long
   comforming systems!

Version 5.1 (not publicly released)

 Daniel Stenberg (Dec 10, 1998)
 - I got a request for a pre-compiled NT Alpha version. Anyone?

 - Added Lynx/CERN www lib proxy environment variable support. That means curl
   now reads and understands the following environment variables:

	HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, FTP_PROXY, GOPHER_PROXY

   They should be set for protocol-specific proxies. General proxy should be
   set with
	
	ALL_PROXY

   And a comma-separated list of host names that shouldn't go through any
   proxy is set in (only an asterisk, '*' matches all hosts).

	NO_PROXY

   The usage of the -x/--proxy flag overrides the environment variables.

 - Proxy can now be specified with a procotol:// prefix.

 - Wrote the curl.1 man page.

 - Introduced a whole new dynamic buffer system for all sprintf()s. It is
   based on the *printf() package by yours truly and Bjorn Reese. Hopefully,
   there aren't that many buffer overflow risks left now.

 - Ah, I should mention I've compiled and built curl successfully under
   solaris 2.6 with gcc now, gcc 2.7.2 won't work but 2.8.1 did ok.

 Oren Tirosh (Dec 3, 1998)
 - Brought two .spec files, to use when creating (Linux) Redhat style RPM
   packages. They're named curl.spec and curl-ssl.spec.

 Troy Engel
 - Supplied the src/Makefile.vc6 for easy compiling with VC++ under Win32.

Version 5.0

 Daniel Stenberg (Dec 1, 1998)
 - Not a single bug report in ages.
 - Corrected getpass.c and main.c to compile warning and error free with the
   Win32 VC++ crap.

Version 5.0 beta 24

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 20, 1998)

 HOW TO BUILD A RELEASE ARCHIVE:

 * Pre-requisite software:
   What		     To build what             Reads data from
   ====              =============             ===============
   GNU automake      Makefile.in, aclocal.m4   configure.in
     GNU make(1)      - " -
     GNU gcc(1)       - " -
   GNU autoconf      configure                 configure.in
   GNU autoheader(2) config.h.in	       configure.in, acconfig.h

 * Make sure all files that should be part of the archive are put in FILES.

 * Run './maketgz' and enter version number of the new to become archive.

   maketgz does:

   - Enters the newly created version number in url.h.
   - (If you don't have automake, this script will warn about that, but unless
     you have changed the Makefile.am files, that is nothing to care about.)
     If you have it, it'll run it.
   - If you have autoconf, the configure.in will be edited to get the newly
     created version number and autoconf will be run.
   - Creates a new directory named curl-<version>. (Actually, it uses the base
     name of the current directory up to the first '-'.)
   - Copies all files mentioned in FILES to the new directory. Saving
     permissions and directory structure.
   - Uses tar to create an archive of it all, named curl-<version>.tar.gz
   - gzips the archive
   - Removes the new directory and all its contents.

 * When done, you have an archive stored in your directory named
   curl-<version>.tar.gz.

   Done!

   (1) They're required to make automake run properly.
   (2) It is distributed as a part of the GNU autoconf archive.

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 18, 1998)
 - I changed the TAG-system. If you ever used urlget() from this package in
   another product, you need to recompile with the new headers. I did this
   new stuff to better deal with different compilers and system with different
   variable sizes. I think it makes it a little more portable. This proves
   to compile warning free with the problematic IRIX compiler!
 - Win32 compiled with a silly error. Corrected now.
 - Brian Chaplin reported yet another problem in
   multiline FTP responses. I've tried to correct it. I mailed him a new
   version and I hope he gets back soon with positive feedback!
 - Improved the 'maketgz' to create a temporary directory tree which it makes
   an archive from instead of the previous renaming of the current one.
 - Mailing list opened (see README).
 - Made -v more verbose on the PASV section of ftp transfers. Now it tells
   host name and IP of the new host (and port number). I also added a section
   about PORT vs PASV in the README.

Version 5.0 beta 21

 Angus Mackay (Nov 15, 1998)
 - Introduced automake stuff.

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 13, 1998)
 - Just made a successful GET of a document from an SSL-server using my own
   private certificate for authentication! The certificate has to be in PEM
   format. You do that the easiest way (although not *that* easy) by
   downloading the SSLyeay PKCS#12-patch by Dr Stephen N. Henson from his site
   at: http://www.drh-consultancy.demon.co.uk/. Using his tool, you can
   convert any modern Netscape or (even) MSIE certificate to PEM-format.  Use
   it with 'curl -E <certificate:password> https://site.com'.  If this isn't a
   cool feature, then I don't know what cool features look like! ;-)
 - Working slowly on telnet connections. #define TRY_TELNET to try it out.
   (curl -u user:passwd "telnet://host.com/cat .login" is one example) I do
   have problem to define how it should work. The prime purpose for this must
   be to get (8bit clean) files via telnet, and it really isn't that easy to
   get files this way. Still having problems with \n being converted to \r\n.

 Angus Mackay (Nov 12, 1998)
 - Corrected another bug in the long parameter name parser.
 - Modified getpass.c (NOTE: see the special licensing in the top of that
   source file).

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 12, 1998)
 - We may have removed the silly warnings from url.c when compiled under IRIX.
   Thanks again to Bjorn Reese and Martin Staael.
 - Wrote formfind.pl which is a new perl script intended to help you find out
   how a FORM submission should be done. This needs a little more work to get
   really good.

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 11, 1998)
 - Made the HTTP header-checker accept white spaces before the HTTP/1.? line.
   Appearantly some proxies/sites add such at times (my test proxy did when I
   downloaded a gopher page with it)!
 - Moved the former -h to -M and made -h show the short help text instead. I
   had to enable a forced help text option. Now an even shorter help text will
   be presented when an unknown option and similar, is used.
 - stdcheaders.h didn't work with IRIX 6.4 native cc compiler. I hope my
   changes don't make other versions go nuts instead.

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 10, 1998)
 - Added a weird check in the configure script to check for the silly AIX
   warnings about my #define strcasecmp() stuff. I do that define to prevent
   me and other contributors to accidentaly use that function name instead
   of strequal()...
 - I bugfixed Angus's getpass.c very little.
 - Fixed the verbose flag names to getopt-style, i.e 'curl --loc' will be
   sufficient instead of --location as "loc" is a unique prefix. Also, anything
   after a '--' is treated as an URL. So if you do have a host with a weeeird
   name you can do 'curl -- -host.com'.
 - Another getopt-adjust; curl now accepts flags after the URL on the command
   line. 'curl www.foo.com -O' is perfectly valid.
 - Corrected the .curlrc parser so that strtok() is no longer used and I
   believe it works better. Even URLs can be specified in it now.

 Angus Mackay (Nov 9, 1998)
 - Replaced getpass.c with a newly written one, not under GPL license
 - Changed OS to a #define in config.h instead of compiler flag
 - Makefile now uses -DHAVE_CONFIG_H

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 9, 1998)
 - Ok, I expanded the tgz-target to update the version string on each occation
   I build a release archive!
 - I reacted on Angus Mackay's initiative and remade the parameter parser to
   be more getopt compliant. Curl now supports "merged" flags as in 
	curl -lsv ftp.site.com
   Do note that I had to move three short-names of the options. Parameters
   that needs an additional string such as -x must be stand-alone or the
   last in a merged sequence:
	curl -lsx my-proxy ftp.site.com
   is ok, but using the flags in a different order like '-lxs' would cause
   unexpected results (as the 's' option would be skipped).
 - I've changed the headers in all files that are subject to the MozPL
   license, as they are supposed to look like when conforming.
 - Made the configure script make the config.h. The former config.h is now
   setup.h.
 - The RESOURCES and TODO files have been added to the archive.

 Angus Mackay (Nov 5, 1998)
 - Fixed getpass.c and various configure stuff

 Daniel Stenberg (Nov 3, 1998)
 - Use -H/--header for custom HTTP-headers. Lets you pass on your own
   specified headers to the remote server. I wouldn't recommend trying to use
   a header with a defined usage according to standards. Use this flag once
   for every custom header you want to add.
 - Use -B/--ftp-ascii to force ftp to use ASCII mode when transfering files.
 - Corrected the 'getlinks.pl' script, I accidentally left my silly proxy
   usage in there! Since the introduction of the .curlrc file, it is easier to
   write scripts that use curl since proxies and stuff should be in the
   .curlrc file anyway.
 - Introducing the new -F flag for HTTP POST. It supports multipart/form-data
   which means it is gonna be possible to upload files etc through HTTP POST.
   Shiraz Kanga asked for the feature and my brother,
   Björn Stenberg helped me design the user
   interface for this beast.  This feature requires quite some docs,
   since it has turned out not only quite capable, but also complicated! :-)
 - A note here, since I've received mail about it. SSLeay versions prior to
   0.8 will *not* work with curl!
 - Wil Langford reported a bug that occurred since curl
   did not properly use CRLF when issuing ftp commands. I fixed it.
 - Rearranged the order config files are read. .curlrc is now *always* read
   first and before the command line flags. -K config files then act as
   additional config items.
 - Use -q AS THE FIRST OPTION specified to prevent .curlrc from being read.
 - You can now disable a proxy by using -x "". Useful if the .curlrc file
   specifies a proxy and you wanna fetch something without going through
   that.
 - I'm thinking of dropping the -p support. Its really not useful since ports
   could (and should?) be specified as :<port> appended on the host name
   instead, both in URLs and to proxy host names.
 - Martin Staael reports curl -L bugs under Windows NT
   (test with URL http://come.to/scsde). This bug is not present in this
   version anymore.
 - Added support for the weird FTP URL type= thing. You can download a file
   using ASCII transfer by appending ";type=A" to the right of it. Other
   available types are type=D for dir-list (NLST) and type=I for binary
   transfer. I can't say I've ever seen anyone use this kind of URL though!
   :-)
 - Troy Engel pointed out a bug in my getenv("HOME")
   usage for win32 systems. I introduce getenv.c to better cope with
   this. Mr Engel helps me with the details around that...
 - A little note to myself and others, I should make the win32-binary built
   with SSL support...
 - Ryan Nelson sent me comments about building curl
   with SSL under FreeBSD. See the Makefile for details. Using the configure
   script, it should work better and automatically now...
 - Cleaned up in the port number mess in the source. No longer stores and uses
   proxy port number separate from normal port number.
 - 'configure' script working. Confirmed compiles on:
    Host         SSL  Compiler
    SunOS 5.5    no   gcc
    SunOS 5.5.1  yes  gcc
    SunOS 5.6    no   cc  (with gcc, it has the "gcc include files" problem)
    SunOS 4.1.3  no   gcc (without ANSI C headers)
    SunOS 4.1.2  no   gcc (native compiler failed)
    Linux 2.0.18 no   gcc
    Linux 2.0.32 yes  gcc
    Linux 2.0.35 no   gcc (with glibc)
    IRIX 6.2     no   gcc (cc compiles generate a few warnings)
    IRIX 6.4     no   cc  (generated warnings though)
    Win32        no   Borland
    OSF4.0	 no   ?

 - Ooops. The 5beta (and 4.10) under win32 failed if the HOME variable wasn't
   set.
 - When using a proxy, curl now guesses and uses the protocol part in cases
   like:
	curl -x proxy:80 www.site.com
   Proxies normally go nuts unless http:// is prepended to the host name, so
   if curl is used like this, it guesses protocol and appends the protocol
   string before passing it to the proxy. It already did this when used
   without proxy.
 - Better port usage with SSL through proxy now. If you specified a different
   https-port when accessing through a proxy, it didn't use that number
   correctly. I also rewrote the code that parses the stuff read from the
   proxy when you wanna connect through it with SSL.
 - Bjorn Reese helped me work around one of the compiler
   warnings on IRIX native cc compiles.

Version 4.10 (Oct 26, 1998)
 Daniel Stenberg
 - John A. Bristor suggested a config file switch,
   and since I've been having that idea kind of in the background for a long
   time I rewrote the parameter parsing function a little and now I introduce
   the -K/--config flag. I also made curl *always* (unless -K is used) try to
   load the .curlrc file for command line parameters. The syntax for the
   config file is the standard command line argument style. Details in 'curl
   -h' or the README.
 - I removed the -k option. Keep-alive isn't really anything anyone would
   want to enable with curl anyway.
 - Martin Staael helped me add the 'irix' target. Now
   "make irix" should build curl successfully on non-gcc SGI machines.
 - Single switches now toggle behaviours. I.e if you use -v -v the second
   will switch off the verbose mode the first one enabled. This is so that
   you can disable a default setting a .curlrc file enables etc.

Version 4.9 (Oct 7, 1998)
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Martin Staael suggested curl would support cookies.
   I added -b/--cookie to enable free-text cookie data to be passed. There's
   also a little blurb about general cookie stuff in the README/help text.
 - dmh <dmh at jet.es> suggested HTTP resume capabilities. Although you could
   manually get curl to resume HTTP documents, I made the -c resume flag work
   for HTTP too (unless -r is used too, which would be very odd anyway).
 - Added checklinks.pl to the archive. It is a still experimental perl script
   that checks all links of a web page by using curl.
 - Rearranged the archive hierarchy a little. Build the executable in the
   src/ dir from now on!
 - Version 4.9 and hereafter, is no longer released under the GPL license.
   I have now updated the LEGAL file etc and now this is released using the
   Mozilla Public License to avoid the plague known as "the GPL virus". You
   must make the source available if you decide to change and/or redistribute
   curl, but if you decide to use curl within something else you do not need
   to offer the world the source to that too.
 - Curl did not like HTTP servers that sent no headers at all on a GET
   request.  It is a violation of RFC2068 but appearantly some servers do
   that anyway.  Thanks to Gordon Beaton for the report!
 - -L/--location was added after a suggestion from Martin Staael. This makes
   curl ATTEMPT to follow the Location: redirect if one is present in the HTTP
   headers. If -i or -I is used with this flag, you will see headers from all
   sites the Location: points to. Do note that the first server can point to a
   second that points to a third etc. It seems the Location: parameter (said
   to be an AbsoluteURI in RFC2068) isn't always absolute.. :-/ Anyway, I've
   made curl ATTEMPT to do the best it can to deal with the reality.
 - Added getlinks.pl to the archive. getlinks.pl selectively downloads
   files that a web page links to.

Version 4.8.4
 Daniel Stenberg
 - As Julian Romero Nieto reported, curl reported wrong version number.
 - As Teemu Yli-Elsila pointed out, the win32 version of 4.8 (and probably all
   other versions for win32) didn't work with binary files since I'm too used
   to the UNIX style fopen() where binary and text don't differ...
 - Ralph Beckmann brought me some changes that lets curl compile error and
   warning free with -Wall -pedantic with g++. I also took the opportunity to
   clean off some unused variables and similar.
 - Ralph Beckmann made me aware of a really odd bug now corrected. When curl
   read a set of headers from a HTTP server, divided into more than one read
   and the first read showed a full line *exactly* (i.e ending with a
   newline), curl did not behave well.

Version 4.8.3
 Daniel Stenberg
 - I was too quick to release 4.8.2 with too little testing. One of the
   changes is now reverted slightly to the 4.8.1 way since 4.8.2 couldn't
   upload files. I still think both problems corrected in 4.8.2 remain
   corrected.  Reported by Julian Romero Nieto.

Version 4.8.2
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Bernhard Iselborn reported two FTP protocol errors curl did. They're now
   corrected. Both appeared when getting files from a MS FTP server! :-)

Version 4.8.1
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Added a last update of the progress meter when the transfer is done. The
   final output on the screen didn't have to be the final size transfered
   which made it sometimes look odd.
 - Thanks to David Long I got rid of a silly bug that happened if a HTTP-page
   had nothing but header. Appearantly Solaris deals with negative sizes in
   fwrite() calls a lot better than Linux does... =B-]

Version 4.8
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Continue FTP file transfer. -c is the switch. Note that you need to
   specify a file name if you wanna resume a download (you can't resume a
   download sent to stdout). Resuming upload may be limited by the server
   since curl is then using the non-RFC959 command SIZE to get the size of
   the target file before upload begins (to figure out which offset to
   use). Use -C to specify the offset yourself! -C is handy if you're doing
   the output to something else but a plain file or when you just want to get
   the end of a file.
 - recursiveftpget.pl now features a maximum recursive level argument.

Version 4.7
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Added support to abort a download if the speed is below a certain amount
   (speed-limit) bytes per second for a certain (speed-time) time.
 - Wrote a perl script 'recursiveftpget.pl' to recursively use curl to get a
   whole ftp directory tree. It is meant as an example of how curl can be
   used.  I agree it isn't the wisest thing to do to make a separate new
   connection for each file and directory for this.

Version 4.6
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Added a first attempt to optionally parse the .netrc file for login user
   and password. If used with http, it enables user authentication. -n is
   the new switch.
 - Removed the extra newlines on the default user-agent string.
 - Corrected the missing ftp upload error messages when it failed without the
   verbose flag set. Gary W. Swearingen found it.
 - Now using alarm() to enable second-precision timeout even on the name
   resolving/connecting phase. The timeout is although reset after that first
   sequence. (This should be corrected.) Gary W. Swearingen reported.
 - Now spells "Unknown" properly, as in "Unknown option 'z'"... :-)
 - Added bug report email address in the README.
 - Added a "current speed" field to the progress meter. It shows the average
   speed the last 5 seconds. The other speed field shows the average speed of
   the entire transfer so far.

Version 4.5.1
 Linas Vepstas
 - SSL through proxy fix
 - Added -A to allow User-Agent: changes

 Daniel Stenberg 
 - Made the -A work when SSL-through-proxy.

Version 4.5
 Linas Vepstas
 - More SSL corrections
 - I've added a port to AIX.
 - running SSL through a proxy causes a chunk of code to be executred twice.
   one of those blocks needs to be deleted.

 Daniel Stenberg
 - Made -i and -I work again

Version 4.4
 Linas Vepstas
 - -x can now also specify proxyport when used as in 'proxyhost:proxyport'
 - SSL fixes

Version 4.3
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Adjusted to compile under win32 (VisualC++ 5). The -P switch does not
   support network interface names in win32. I couldn't figure out how!

Version 4.2
 Linas Vepstas / Sampo Kellomaki
 - Added SSL / SSLeay support (https://)
 - Added the -T usage for HTTP POST.

 Daniel Stenberg
 - Bugfixed the SSL implementation.
 - Made -P a lot better to use other IP addresses. It now accepts a following
   parameter that can be either
        interface - i.e "eth0" to specify which interface's IP address you
                    want to use
        IP address - i.e "192.168.10.1" to specify exact IP number
        host name - i.e "my.host.domain" to specify machine
        "-"       - (any single-letter string) to make it pick the machine's
                    default
 - The Makefile is now ready to compile for solaris, sunos4 and linux right
   out of the box.
 - Better generated version string seen with 'curl -V'

Version 4.1
 Daniel Stenberg
 - The IP number returned by the ftp server as a reply to PASV does no longer
   have to DNS resolve. In fact, no IP-number-only addresses have to anymore.
 - Binds better to available port when -P is used.
 - Now LISTs ./ instead of / when used as in ftp://ftp.funet.fi/. The reason
   for this is that exactly that site, ftp.funet.fi, does not allow LIST /
   while LIST ./ is fine. Any objections?

Version 4 (1998-03-20)
 Daniel Stenberg
 - I took another huge step and changed both version number and project name!
   The reason for the new name is that there are just one too many programs
   named urlget already and this program already can a lot more than merely
   getting URLs, and the reason for the version number is that I did add the
   pretty big change in -P and since I changed name I wanted to start with
   something fresh!
 - The --style flags are working better now.
 - Listing directories with FTP often reported that the file transfer was
   incomplete. Wrong assumptions were too common for directories, why no
   size will be attempted to get compared on them from now on.
 - Implemented the -P flag that let's the ftp control issue a PORT command
   instead of the standard PASV.
 - -a for appending FTP uploads works.

***************************************************************************

Version 3.12 (14 March 1998)
 Daniel Stenberg
 - End-of-header tracking still lacked support for \r\n or just \n at the
   end of the last header line.
 Sergio Barresi
 - Added PROXY authentication.
 Rafael Sagula
 - Fixed some little bugs.

Version 3.11
 Daniel Stenberg
 - The header parsing was still not correct since the 3.2 modification...

Version 3.10
 Daniel Stenberg
 - 3.7 and 3.9 were simultaneously developed and merged into this version.
 - FTP upload did not work correctly since 3.2.

Version 3.9
 Rafael Sagula
 - Added the "-e <url> / --referer <url>" option where we can specify
   the referer page. Obviously, this is necessary only to fool the
   server, but...

Version 3.7
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Now checks the last error code sent from the ftp server after a file has
   been received or uploaded. Wasn't done previously.
 - When 'urlget <host>' is used without a 'protocol://' first in the host part,
   it now checks for host names starting with ftp or gopher and if it does,
   it uses that protocol by default instead of http.

Version 3.6
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Silly mistake made the POST bug. This has now also been tested to work with
   proxy.

Version 3.5
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Highly inspired by Rafael Sagula's changes to the 3.1 that added an almost
   functional POST, I applied his changes into this version and made them work.
   (It seems POST requires the Content-Type and Content-Length headers.) It is
   now usable with the -d switch.

Version 3.3 - 3.4
 Passed to avoid confusions

Version 3.2
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Major rewrite of two crucial parts of this code: upload and download.
   They are both now using a select() switch, that allows much better
   progress meter and time control. 
 - alarm() usage removed completely
 - FTP get can now list directory contents if the path ends with a slash '/'.
   Urlget on a ftp-path that doesn't end with a slash means urlget will
   attempt getting it as a file name.
 - FTP directory view supports -l for "list-only" which lists the file names
   only.
 - All operations support -m for max time usage in seconds allowed.
 - FTP upload now allows the size of the uploaded file to be provided, and
   thus it can better check it actually uploaded the whole file. It also
   makes the progress meter for uploads much better!
 - Made the parameter parsing fail in cases like 'urlget -r 900' which
   previously tried to connect to the host named '900'.

Version 3.1
 Kjell Ericson
 - Pointed out how to correct the 3 warnings in win32-compiles.

 Daniel Stenberg
 - Removed all calls to exit().
 - Made the short help text get written to stdout instead of stderr.
 - Made this file instead of keeping these comments in the source.
 - Made two callback hooks, that enable external programs to use urlget()
   easier and to grab the output/offer the input easier.
 - It is evident that Win32-compiles are painful. I watched the output from
   the Borland C++ v5 and it was awful. Just ignore all those warnings.

Version 3.0
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Added FTP upload capabilities. The name urlget gets a bit silly now
   when we can put too... =)
 - Restructured the source quite a lot.
   Changed the urlget() interface. This way, we will survive changes much
   better. New features can come and old can be removed without us needing
   to change the interface. I've written a small explanation in urlget.h
   that explains it.
 - New flags include -t, -T, -O and -h. The -h text is generated by the new
   mkhelp script.

Version 2.9
 Remco van Hooff
 - Added a fix to make it compile smoothly on Amiga using the SAS/C
   compiler.
  
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Believe it or not, but the STUPID Novell web server seems to require
   that the Host: keyword is used, so well I use it and I (re-introduce) the
   urlget User-Agent:. I still have to check that this Host: usage works with
   proxies... 'Host:' is required for HTTP/1.1 GET according to RFC2068.

Version 2.8
 Rafael Sagula
 - some little modifications

Version 2.7
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Removed the -l option and introduced the -f option instead. Now I'll
   rewrite the former -l kludge in an external script that'll use urlget to
   fetch multipart files like that.
 - '-f' is introduced, it means Fail without output in case of HTTP server
   errors (return code >=300).
 - Added support for -r, ranges. Specify which part of a document you 
   want, and only that part is returned. Only with HTTP/1.1-servers.
 - Split up the source in 3 parts. Now all pure URL functions are in
   urlget.c and stuff that deals with the stand-alone program is in main.c.
 - I took a few minutes and wrote an embryo of a README file to explain
   a few things.

Version 2.6
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Made the -l (loop) thing use the new CONF_FAILONERROR which makes
   urlget() return error code if non-successful. It also won't output anything
   then. Now finally removed the HTTP 1.0 and error 404 dependencies.
 - Added -I which uses the HEAD request to get the header only from a
   http-server.

Version 2.5
 Rafael Sagula
 - Made the progress meter use HHH:MM:SS instead of only seconds.

Version 2.4
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Added progress meter. It appears when downloading > BUFFER SIZE and
   mute is not selected. I found out that when downloading large files from
   really really slow sites, it is desirable to know the status of the
   download. Do note that some downloads are done unawaring of the size, which
   makes the progress meter less thrilling ;) If the output is sent to a tty,
   the progress meter is shut off.
 - Increased buffer size used for reading.
 - Added length checks in the user+passwd parsing.
 - Made it grok user+passwd for HTTP fetches. The trick is to base64
   encode the user+passwd and send an extra header line. Read chapter 11.1 in
   RFC2068 for details. I added it to be used just like the ftp one.  To get a
   http document from a place that requires user and password, use an URL
   like:

        http://user:passwd@www.site.to.leach/doc.html

   I also added the -u flag, since WHEN USING A PROXY YOU CAN'T SPECIFY THE
   USER AND PASSWORD WITH HTTP LIKE THAT. The -u flag works for ftp too, but
   not if used with proxy. To do the same as the above one, you can invoke:

        urlget -u user:passwd http://www.site.to.leach/doc.html

Version 2.3
 Rafael Sagula
 - Added "-o" option (output file)
 - Added URG_HTTP_NOT_FOUND return code.
   (Daniel's note:)
   Perhaps we should detect all kinds of errors and instead of writing that
   custom string for the particular 404-error, use the error text we actually
   get from the server. See further details in RFC2068 (HTTP 1.1
   definition). The current way also relies on a HTTP/1.0 reply, which newer
   servers might not do.
 - Looping mode ("-l" option). It's easier to get various split files.
   (Daniel's note:)
   Use it like 'urlget -l 1 http://from.this.site/file%d.html', which will
   make urlget to attempt to fetch all files named file1.html, file2.html etc
   until no more files are found. This is only a modification of the
   STAND_ALONE part, nothing in the urlget() function was modfified for this.
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Changed the -h to be -i instead. -h should be preserved to help use.
 - Bjorn Reese indicated that Borland _might_ use '_WIN32' instead of the
   VC++ WIN32 define and therefore I added a little fix for that.

Version 2.2
 Johan Andersson
 - The urlget function didn't set the path to url when using proxy.
 - Fixed bug with IMC proxy. Now using (almost) complete GET command.
  
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Made it compile on Solaris. Had to reorganize the includes a bit.
   (so Win32, Linux, SunOS 4 and Solaris 2 compile fine.)
 - Made Johan's keepalive keyword optional with the -k flag (since it
   makes a lot of urlgets take a lot longer time).
 - Made a '-h' switch in case you want the HTTP-header in the output.

Version 2.1
 Daniel Stenberg and Kjell Ericson
 - Win32-compilable
 - No more global variables
 - Mute option (no output at all to stderr)
 - Full range of return codes from urlget(), which is now written to be a
   function for easy-to-use in [other] programs.
 - Define STAND_ALONE to compile the stand alone urlget program
 - Now compiles with gcc options -ansi -Wall -pedantic ;)

Version 2.0
 - Introducing ftp GET support. The FTP URL type is recognized and used.
 - Renamed the project to 'urlget'.
 - Supports the user+passwd in the FTP URL (otherwise it tries anonymous
   login with a weird email address as password).

Version 1.5
 Daniel Stenberg
 - The skip_header() crap messed it up big-time. By simply removing that
   one we can all of a sudden download anything ;)
 - No longer requires a trailing slash on the URLs.
 - If the given URL isn't prefixed with 'http://', HTTP is assumed and
   given a try!
 - 'void main()' is history.

Version 1.4
 Daniel Stenberg
 - The gopher source used the ppath variable instead of path which could
   lead to disaster.

Version 1.3
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Well, I added a lame text about the time it took to get the data. I also
   fought against Johan to prevent his -f option (to specify a file name
   that should be written instead of stdout)! =)
 - Made it write 'connection refused' for that particular connect()
   problem.
 - Renumbered the version. Let's not make silly 1.0.X versions, this is
   a plain 1.3 instead.

Version 1.2
 Johan Andersson
 - Discovered and fixed the problem with getting binary files. puts() is
   now replaced with fwrite(). (Daniel's note: this also fixed the buffer
   overwrite problem I found in the previous version.)

 Rafael Sagula
 - Let "-p" before "-x".

 Daniel Stenberg
 - Bugfixed the proxy usage. It should *NOT* use nor strip the port number
   from the URL but simply pass that information to the proxy. This also
   made the user/password fields possible to use in proxy [ftp-] URLs.
   (like in ftp://user:password@ftp.my.site:8021/README)

 Johan Andersson
 - Implemented HTTP proxy support.
 - Receive byte counter added.

 Bjorn Reese
 - Implemented URLs (and skipped the old syntax).
 - Output is written to stdout, so to achieve the above example, do:
   httpget http://143.54.10.6/info_logo.gif > test.gif

Version 1.1
 Daniel Stenberg
 - Adjusted it slightly to accept named hosts on the command line. We
   wouldn't wanna use IP numbers for the rest of our lifes, would we?

Version 1.0
  Rafael Sagula
  - Wrote the initial httpget, which started all this!
