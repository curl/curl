Note:

Files located in subdirectory 'vs/t' and below are 'templates' used for
the generation of msvc IDE workspace and project files, distributed in
subdirectories 'vs/vc6' and 'vs/vc8'.

All these template files use UNIX line endings intentionally, in order
to allow proper file generation. Don't convert these to crlf line-ends.
