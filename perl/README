Perl

 Perl's a great script language, not the least for quick prototyping. Curl is
elegantly used from within it. You can either invoke external curl command
line or use the curl interface.

The latest release of Curl_easy, a Perl interface to curl is available from

	http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/perl/

(Georg Horn's original version of Curl_easy, supporting curl versions
before 7.7 is still available from: http://www.koblenz-net.de/~horn/export/ )

Using the Curl::easy module is just straightforward and
works much like using libcurl in a C programm, so please refer to the
documentation of libcurl. Have a look at test.pl to get an idea of how
to start.
