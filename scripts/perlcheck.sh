# The xargs invocation is portable, but does not preserve spaces in file names.
# If such a file is ever added, then this can be portably fixed by switching to
# "xargs -I{}" and appending {} to the end of the xargs arguments (which will
# call cmakelint once per file) or by using the GNU extension "xargs -d'\n'".
