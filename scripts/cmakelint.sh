# Run cmakelint on the curl source code. It will check all files given on the
# command-line, or else all relevant files in git, or if not in a git
# repository, all files starting in the tree rooted in the current directory.
#
# cmake-lint can be installed from PyPi with the command "python3 -m pip
# install cmakelang".
#
# The xargs invocation is portable, but does not preserve spaces in file names.
# If such a file is ever added, then this can be portably fixed by switching to
# "xargs -I{}" and appending {} to the end of the xargs arguments (which will
# call cmakelint once per file) or by using the GNU extension "xargs -d'\n'".
