                                  Changelog

Daniel S (7 May 2007)
- James Bursa fixed a bug in the multi handle code that made the connection
  cache grow a bit too much, beyond the normal 4 * easy_handles.

Daniel S (2 May 2007)
- Anders Gustafsson remarked that requiring CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION set to 1.0
  when CURLOPT_HTTP200ALIASES is used to avoid the problem mentioned below is
  not very nice if the client wants to be able to use _either_ a HTTP 1.1
  server or one within the aliases list... so starting now, libcurl will
  simply consider 200-alias matches the to be HTTP 1.0 compliant.

- Tobias Rundström reported a problem they experienced with xmms2 and recent
  libcurls, which turned out to be the 25-nov-2006 change which treats HTTP
  responses without Content-Length or chunked encoding as without bodies. We
  now added the conditional that the above mentioned response is only without
  body if the response is HTTP 1.1.

- Jeff Pohlmeyer improved the hiperfifo.c example to use the
  CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION callback option.

- Set the timeout for easy handles to expire really soon after addition or
  when CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM is returned from curl_multi_socket*/perform,
  to make applications using only curl_multi_socket() to properly function
  when adding easy handles "on the fly". Bug report and test app provided by
  Michael Wallner.

Dan F (30 April 2007)
- Improved the test harness to allow running test servers on other than
  the default port numbers, allowing more than one test suite to run
  simultaneously on the same host.

Daniel S (28 April 2007)
- Peter O'Gorman fixed libcurl to not init GnuTLS as early as we did before,
  since it then inits libgcrypt and libgcrypt is being evil and EXITS the
  application if it fails to get a fine random seed. That's really not a nice
  thing to do by a library.

- Frank Hempel fixed a curl_easy_duphandle() crash on a handle that had
  been removed from a multi handle, and then fixed another flaw that prevented
  curl_easy_duphandle() to work even after the first fix - the handle was
  still marked as using the multi interface.

Daniel S (26 April 2007)
- Peter O'Gorman found a problem with SCP downloads when the downloaded file
  was 16385 bytes (16K+1) and it turned out we didn't properly always "suck
  out" all data from libssh2. The effect being that libcurl would hang on the
  socket waiting for data when libssh2 had in fact already read it all...

Dan F (25 April 2007)
- Added support in runtests.pl for "!n" test numbers to disable individual
  tests.  Changed -t to only keep log files around when -k is specified,
  to have the same behaviour as without -t.

Daniel S (25 April 2007)
- Sonia Subramanian brought our attention to a problem that happens if you set
  the CURLOPT_RESUME_FROM or CURLOPT_RANGE options and an existing connection
  in the connection cache is closed to make room for the new one when you call
  curl_easy_perform(). It would then wrongly free range-related data in the
  connection close funtion.

Yang Tse (25 April 2007)
- Steve Little fixed compilation on VMS 64-bit mode

Daniel S (24 April 2007)
- Robert Iakobashvili made the 'master_buffer' get allocated first once it is
  can/will be used as it then makes the common cases save 16KB of data for each
  easy handle that isn't used for pipelining.

Dan F (23 April 2007)
- Added <postcheck> support to the test harness.

- Added tests 610-612 to test more SFTP post-quote commands.

Daniel S (22 April 2007)
- Song Ma's warning if -r/--range is given with a "bad" range, also noted in
  the man page now.

- Daniel Black filed bug #1705177
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1705177) where --without-ssl
  --with-gnutl outputs a warning about SSL not being enabled even though GnuTLS
  was found and used.

Daniel S (21 April 2007)
- Daniel Black filed bug #1704675
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1704675) identifying a double-free
  problem in the SSL-dealing layer, telling GnuTLS to free NULL credentials on
  closedown after a failure and a bad #ifdef for NSS when closing down SSL.

Yang Tse (20 April 2007)
- Save one call to curlx_tvnow(), which calls gettimeofday(), in each of
  Curl_socket_ready(), Curl_poll() and Curl_select() when these are called
  with a zero timeout or a timeout value indicating a blocking call should
  be performed.

Daniel S (18 April 2007)
- James Housley made SFTP uploads use libssh2's non-blocking API

- Prevent the internal progress meter from updating more frequently than once
  per second.

Dan F (17 April 2007)
- Added test cases 296, 297 and 298 to test --ftp-method handling

Daniel S (16 April 2007)
- Robert Iakobashvil added curl_multi_socket_action() to libcurl, which is a
  function that deprecates the curl_multi_socket() function. Using the new
  function the application tell libcurl what action that was found in the
  socket that it passes in. This gives a significant performance boost as it
  allows libcurl to avoid a call to poll()/select() for every call to
  curl_multi_socket*().

  I added a define in the public curl/multi.h header file that will make your
  existing application automatically use curl_multi_socket_action() instead of
  curl_multi_socket() when you recompile. But of course you'll get better
  performance if you adjust your code manually and actually pass in the
  correct action bitmask to this function.

Daniel S (14 April 2007)
- Jay Austin added "DH PARAMETERS" to the stunnel.pem certificate for the test
  suite to make stunnel run better in some (most?) environments.

Dan F (13 April 2007)
- Added test cases 294 and 295 to test --ftp-account handling

- Improved handling of out of memory in ftp.

Yang Tse (13 April 2007)
- Fix test case 534 which started to fail 2007-04-13 due to the existance
  of a new host on the net with the same silly domain the test was using
  for a host which was supposed not to exist.

Daniel S (12 April 2007)
- Song Ma found a memory leak in the if2ip code if you pass in an interface
  name longer than the name field of the ifreq struct (typically 6 bytes), as
  then it wouldn't close the used dummy socket. Bug #1698974
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1698974)

Version 7.16.2 (11 April 2007)

Yang Tse (10 April 2007)
- Ravi Pratap provided some fixes for HTTP pipelining

- configure script will ignore --enable-sspi option for non-native Windows.

Daniel S (9 April 2007)
- Nick Zitzmann did ssh.c cleanups

Daniel S (3 April 2007)
- Rob Jones fixed better #ifdef'ing for a bunch of #include lines.

Daniel S (2 April 2007)
- Nick Zitzmann made the CURLOPT_POSTQUOTE option work for SFTP as well. The
  accepted commands are as follows:

  chgrp (gid) (path)
    Changes the group ID of the file or directory at (path) to (gid). (gid)
    must be a number.

  chmod (perms) (path)
    Changes the permissions of the file or directory at (path) to
    (perms). (perms) must be a number in the format used by the chmod Unix
    command.

  chown (uid) (path)
    Changes the user ID of the file or directory at (path) to (uid). (uid)
    must be a number.

  ln (source) (dest)
    Creates a symbolic link at (dest) that points to the file located at
    (source).

  mkdir (path)
    Creates a new directory at (path).

  rename (source) (dest)
    Moves the file or directory at (source) to (dest).

  rm (path)
    Deletes the file located at (path).

  rmdir (path)
    Deletes the directory located at (path). This command will raise an error
    if the directory is not empty.

  symlink (source) (dest)
    Same as ln.

Daniel S (1 April 2007)
- Robert Iakobashvili made curl_multi_remove_handle() a lot faster when many
  easy handles are added to a multi handle, by avoiding the looping over all
  the handles to find which one to remove.

- Matt Kraai provided a patch that makes curl build on QNX 6 fine again.

Daniel S (31 March 2007)
- Fixed several minor issues detected by the coverity.com scanner.

- "Pixel" fixed a problem that appeared when you used -f with user+password
  embedded in the URL.

Dan F (29 March 2007)
- Don't tear down the ftp connection if the maximum filesize was exceeded
  and added tests 290 and 291 to check.

- Added ftps upload and SSL required tests 401 and 402.

- Send an EOF message before closing an SCP channel, as recommended by
  RFC4254. Enable libssh2 tracing when ssh debugging is turned on.

Yang Tse (27 March 2007)
- Internal function Curl_select() renamed to Curl_socket_ready()

  New Internal wrapper function Curl_select() around select (2), it
  uses poll() when a fine poll() is available, so now libcurl can be
  built without select() support at all if a fine poll() is available.

Daniel S (25 March 2007)
- Daniel Johnson fixed multi code to traverse the easy handle list properly.
  A left-over bug from the February 21 fix.

Dan F (23 March 2007)
- Added --pubkey option to curl and made --key also work for SCP/SFTP,
  plus made --pass work on an SSH private key as well.

- Changed the test harness to attempt to gracefully shut down servers
  before resorting to the kill -9 hammer.

- Added test harness infrastructure to support scp/sftp tests, using
  OpenSSH as the server.

- Fixed a memory leak when specifying a proxy with a file: URL.

Yang Tse (20 March 2007)
- Fixed: When a signal was caught awaiting for an event using Curl_select()
  or Curl_poll() with a non-zero timeout both functions would restart the
  specified timeout. This could even lead to the extreme case that if a
  signal arrived with a frecuency lower to the specified timeout neither
  function would ever exit.

  Added experimental symbol definition check CURL_ACKNOWLEDGE_EINTR in
  Curl_select() and Curl_poll(). When compiled with CURL_ACKNOWLEDGE_EINTR
  defined both functions will return as soon as a signal is caught. Use it
  at your own risk, all calls to these functions in the library should be
  revisited and checked before fully supporting this feature.

Yang Tse (19 March 2007)
- Bryan Henderson fixed the progress function so that it can get called more
  frequently allowing same calling frecuency for the client progress callback.
  
Dan F (15 March 2007)
- Various memory leaks plugged and NULL pointer fixes made in the ssh code.

Daniel (15 March 2007)
- Nick made the curl tool accept globbing ranges that only is one number, i.e
  you can now use [1-1] without curl complaining.

Daniel (10 March 2007)
- Eygene Ryabinkin:

  The problem is the following: when we're calling Curl_done and it decides to
  keep the connection opened ('left intact'), then the caller is not notified
  that the connection was done via the NULLifying of the pointer, so some easy
  handle is keeping the pointer to this connection.

  Later ConnectionExists can select such connection for reuse even if we're
  not pipelining: pipeLen is zero, so the (pipeLen > 0 && !canPipeline) is
  false and we can reuse this connection for another easy handle. But thus the
  connection will be shared between two easy handles if the handle that wants
  to take the ownership is not the same as was not notified of the connection
  was done in Curl_done. And when some of these easy handles will get their
  connection really freed the another one will still keep the pointer.

  My fix was rather trivial: I just added the NULLification to the 'else'
  branch in the Curl_done. My tests with Git and ElectricFence showed no
  problems both for HTTP pulling and cloning. Repository size is about 250 Mb,
  so it was a considerable amount of Curl's work.

Dan F (9 March 2007)
- Updated the test harness to add a new "crypto" feature check and updated the
  appropriate test case to use it.  For now, this is treated the same as the
  "SSL" feature because curl doesn't list it separately.

Daniel (9 March 2007)
- Robert Iakobashvili fixed CURLOPT_INTERFACE for IPv6.

- Robert A. Monat improved the maketgz and VC6/8 generating to set the correct
  machine type too.

- Justin Fletcher fixed a file descriptor leak in the curl tool when trying to
  upload a file it couldn't open. Bug #1676581
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1676581)

Dan F (9 March 2007)
- Updated the test harness to check for protocol support before running each
  test, fixing KNOWN_BUGS #11.

Dan F (7 March 2007)
- Reintroduced (after a 3 year hiatus) an FTPS test case (400) into the test
  harness.  It is very limited as it supports only ftps:// URLs with
  --ftp-ssl-control specified, which implicitly encrypts the control
  channel but not the data channels.  That allows stunnel to be used with
  an unmodified ftp server in exactly the same way that the test https
  server is set up.

Dan F (7 March 2007)
- Honour --ftp-ssl-control on ftps:// URLs to allow encrypted control and
  unencrypted data connections.

Dan F (6 March 2007)
- Fixed a couple of improper pointer uses detected by valgrind in test
  cases 181 & 216.

Daniel (2 March 2007)
- Robert A. Monat and Shmulik Regev helped out to fix the new */Makefile.vc8
  makefiles that are included in the source release archives, generated from
  the Makefile.vc6 files by the maketgz script. I also modified the root
  Makefile to have a VC variable that defaults to vc6 but can be overridden to
  allow it to be used for vc8 as well. Like this:

    nmake VC=vc8 vc

Daniel (27 February 2007)
- Hang Kin Lau found and fixed: When I use libcurl to connect to an https
  server through a proxy and have the remote https server port set using the
  CURLOPT_PORT option, protocol gets reset to http from https after the first
  request.
 
  User defined URL was modified internally by libcurl and subsequent reuse of
  the easy handle may lead to connection using a different protocol (if not
  originally http).
 
  I found that libcurl hardcoded the protocol to "http" when it tries to
  regenerate the URL if CURLOPT_PORT is set. I tried to fix the problem as
  follows and it's working fine so far

Daniel (25 February 2007)
- Adam D. Moss made the HTTP CONNECT procedure less blocking when used from
  the multi interface. Note that it still does a part of the connection in a
  blocking manner.

Daniel (23 February 2007)
- Added warning outputs if the command line uses more than one of the options
  -v, --trace and --trace-ascii, since it could really confuse the user.
  Clarified this fact in the man page.

Daniel (21 February 2007)
- Ravi Pratap provided work on libcurl making pipelining more robust and
  fixing some bugs:
  o Don't mix GET and POST requests in a pipeline
  o Fix the order in which requests are dispatched from the pipeline
  o Fixed several curl bugs with pipelining when the server is returning
    chunked encoding:
    * Added states to chunked parsing for final CRLF
    * Rewind buffer after parsing chunk with data remaining
    * Moved chunked header initializing to a spot just before receiving
      headers

Daniel (20 February 2007)
- Linus Nielsen Feltzing changed the CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC option to handle
  active and passive CCC shutdown and added the --ftp-ssl-ccc-mode command
  line option.

Daniel (19 February 2007)
- Ian Turner fixed the libcurl.m4 macro's support for --with-libcurl.

- Shmulik Regev found a memory leak in re-used HTTPS connections, at least
  when the multi interface was used.

- Robson Braga Araujo made passive FTP transfers work with SOCKS (both 4 and
  5).

Daniel (18 February 2007)
- Jeff Pohlmeyer identified two problems: first a rather obscure problem with
  the multi interface and connection re-use that could make a
  curl_multi_remove_handle() ruin a pointer in another handle.

  The second problem was less of an actual problem but more of minor quirk:
  the re-using of connections wasn't properly checking if the connection was
  marked for closure.

Daniel (16 February 2007)
- Duncan Mac-Vicar Prett and Michal Marek reported problems with resetting
  CURLOPT_RANGE back to no range on an easy handle when using FTP.

Dan F (14 February 2007)
- Fixed curl-config --libs so it doesn't list unnecessary libraries (and
  therefore introduce unnecessary dependencies) when it's not needed.
  Also, don't bother adding a library path of /usr/lib

Daniel (13 February 2007)
- The default password for anonymous FTP connections is now changed to be
  "ftp@example.com".

- Robert A. Monat made libcurl build fine with VC2005 - it doesn't have
  gmtime_r() like the older VC versions. He also made use of some machine-
  specific defines to differentiate the "OS" define.

Daniel (12 February 2007)
- Rob Crittenden added support for NSS (Network Security Service) for the
  SSL/TLS layer. http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/

  This is the fourth supported library for TLS/SSL that libcurl supports!

- Shmulik Regev fixed so that the final CRLF of HTTP response headers are sent
  to the debug callback.

- Shmulik Regev added CURLOPT_HTTP_CONTENT_DECODING and
  CURLOPT_HTTP_TRANSFER_DECODING that if set to zero will disable libcurl's
  internal decoding of content or transfer encoded content. This may be
  preferable in cases where you use libcurl for proxy purposes or similar. The
  command line tool got a --raw option to disable both at once.

- release tarballs made with maketgz will from now on have a LIBCURL_TIMESTAMP
  define set to hold the exact date and time of when the tarball was built, as
  a human readable string using the UTC time zone.
  
- Jeff Pohlmeyer fixed a flaw in curl_multi_add_handle() when adding a handle
  that has an easy handle present in the "closure" list pending closure.

Daniel (6 February 2007)
- Regular file downloads wiht SFTP and SCP are now done using the non-blocking
  API of libssh2, if the libssh2 headers seem to support them. This will make
  SCP and SFTP much more responsive and better libcurl citizens when used with
  the multi interface etc.

Daniel (5 February 2007)
- Michael Wallner added support for CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS and
  CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT_MS that, as their names suggest, do the timeouts with
  millisecond resolution. The only restriction to that is the alarm()
  (sometimes) used to abort name resolves as that uses full seconds. I fixed
  the FTP response timeout part of the patch.

  Internally we now count and keep the timeouts in milliseconds but it also
  means we multiply set timeouts with 1000. The effect of this is that no
  timeout can be set to more than 2^31 milliseconds (on 32 bit systems), which
  equals 24.86 days.  We probably couldn't before either since the code did
  *1000 on the timeout values on several places already.

Daniel (3 February 2007)
- Yang Tse fixed the cookie expiry date in several test cases that started to
  fail since they used "1 feb 2007"...

- Manfred Schwarb reported that socks5 support was broken and help us pinpoint
  the problem. The code now tries harder to use httproxy and proxy where
  apppropriate, as not all proxies are HTTP...

Version 7.16.1 (29 January 2007)

Daniel (29 January 2007)
- Michael Wallner reported that when doing a CONNECT with a custom User-Agent
  header, you got _two_ User-Agent headers in the CONNECT request...! Added
  test case 287 to verify the fix.

Daniel (28 January 2007)
- curl_easy_reset() now resets the CA bundle path correctly.

- David McCreedy fixed the Curl command line tool for HTTP on non-ASCII
  platforms.

Daniel (25 January 2007)
- Added the --libcurl [file] option to curl. Append this option to any
  ordinary curl command line, and you will get a libcurl-using source code
  written to the file that does the equivalent operation of what your command
  line operation does!

Dan F (24 January 2007)
- Fixed a dangling pointer problem that prevented the http_proxy environment
  variable from being properly used in many cases (and caused test case 63
  to fail).

Daniel (23 January 2007)
- David McCreedy did NTLM changes mainly for non-ASCII platforms:

  #1
  There's a compilation error in http_ntlm.c if USE_NTLM2SESSION is NOT
  defined.  I noticed this while testing various configurations.  Line 867 of
  the current http_ntlm.c is a closing bracket for an if/else pair that only
  gets compiled in if USE_NTLM2SESSION is defined.  But this closing bracket
  wasn't in an #ifdef so the code fails to compile unless USE_NTLM2SESSION was
  defined.  Lines 198 and 140 of my patch wraps that closing bracket in an
  #ifdef USE_NTLM2SESSION.

  #2
  I noticed several picky compiler warnings when DEBUG_ME is defined.  I've
  fixed them with casting.  By the way, DEBUG_ME was a huge help in
  understanding this code.

  #3
  Hopefully the last non-ASCII conversion patch for libcurl in a while.  I
  changed the "NTLMSSP" literal to hex since this signature must always be in
  ASCII.

  Conversion code was strategically added where necessary.  And the
  Curl_base64_encode calls were changed so the binary "blobs" http_ntlm.c
  creates are NOT translated on non-ASCII platforms.

Dan F (22 January 2007)
- Converted (most of) the test data files into genuine XML.  A handful still
  are not, due mainly to the lack of support for XML character entities
  (e.g. & => &amp; ).  This will make it easier to validate test files using
  tools like xmllint, as well as to edit and view them using XML tools.

Daniel (16 January 2007)
- Armel Asselin improved libcurl to behave a lot better when an easy handle
  doing an FTP transfer is removed from a multi handle before completion. The
  fix also fixed the "alive counter" to be correct on "premature removal" for
  all protocols.

Dan F (16 January 2007)
- Fixed a small memory leak in tftp uploads discovered by curl's memory leak
  detector.  Also changed tftp downloads to URL-unescape the downloaded
  file name.

Daniel (14 January 2007)
- David McCreedy provided libcurl changes for doing HTTP communication on
  non-ASCII platforms. It does add some complexity, most notably with more
  #ifdefs, but I want to see this supported added and I can't see how we can
  add it without the extra stuff added.

- Setting CURLOPT_COOKIELIST to "ALL" when no cookies at all was present,
  libcurl would crash when trying to read a NULL pointer.

Daniel (12 January 2007)
- Toby Peterson found a nasty bug that prevented (lib)curl from properly
  downloading (most) things that were larger than 4GB on 32 bit systems.  Matt
  Witherspoon helped as narrow down the problem.

Daniel (5 January 2007)
- Linus Nielsen Feltzing introduced the --ftp-ssl-ccc command line option to
  curl that uses the new CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC option in libcurl. If enabled, it
  will make libcurl shutdown SSL/TLS after the authentication is done on a
  FTP-SSL operation.

Daniel (4 January 2007)
- David McCreedy made changes to allow base64 encoding/decoding to work on
  non-ASCII platforms.

Daniel (3 January 2007)
- Matt Witherspoon fixed the flaw which made libcurl 7.16.0 always store
  downloaded data in two buffers, just to be able to deal with a special HTTP
  pipelining case. That is now only activated for pipelined transfers. In
  Matt's case, it showed as a considerable performance difference,

Daniel (2 January 2007)
- Victor Snezhko helped us fix bug report #1603712
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1603712) (known bug #36) --limit-rate
  (CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE) are broken
  on Windows (since 7.16.0, but that's when they were introduced as previous
  to that the limiting logic was made in the application only and not in the
  library). It was actually also broken on select()-based systems (as apposed
  to poll()) but we haven't had any such reports. We now use select(), Sleep()
  or delay() properly to sleep a while without waiting for anything input or
  output when the rate limiting is activated with the easy interface.

- Modified libcurl.pc.in to use Libs.private for the libs libcurl itself needs
  to get built static. It has been mentioned before and was again brought to
  our attention by Nathanael Nerode who filed debian bug report #405226
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=405226).
