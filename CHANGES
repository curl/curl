                                  Changelog

Version 7.16.0 (30 October 2006)

Daniel (25 October 2006)
- Fixed CURLOPT_FAILONERROR to return CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR even for the
  case when 401 or 407 are returned, *IF* no auth credentials have been given.
  The CURLOPT_FAILONERROR option is not possible to make fool-proof for 401
  and 407 cases when auth credentials is given, but we've now covered this
  somewhat more.

  You might get some amounts of headers transferred before this situation is
  detected, like for when a "100-continue" is received as a response to a
  POST/PUT and a 401 or 407 is received immediately afterwards.

  Added test 281 to verify this change.

Daniel (23 October 2006)
- Ravi Pratap provided a major update with pipelining fixes. We also no longer
  re-use connections (for pipelining) before the name resolving is done.

Daniel (21 October 2006)
- Nir Soffer made the tests/libtest/Makefile.am use a proper variable for all
  the single test applications' link and dependences, so that you easier can
  override those from the command line when using make.

- Armel Asselin separated CA cert verification problems from problems with
  reading the (local) CA cert file to let users easier pinpoint the actual
  problem. CURLE_SSL_CACERT_BADFILE (77) is the new libcurl error code.

Daniel (18 October 2006)
- Removed the "protocol-guessing" for URLs with host names starting with FTPS
  or TELNET since they are practically non-existant. This leaves us with only
  three different prefixes that would assume the protocol is anything but
  HTTP, and they are host names starting with "ftp.", "dict." or "ldap.".

Daniel (17 October 2006)
- Bug report #1579171 pointed out code flaws detected with "prefast", and they
  were 1 - a too small memory clear with memset() in the threaded resolver and
  2 - a range of potentially bad uses of the ctype family of is*() functions
  such as isdigit(), isalnum(), isprint() and more. The latter made me switch
  to using our own set of these functions/macros using uppercase letters, and
  with some extra set of crazy typecasts to avoid mistakingly passing in
  negative numbers to the underlying is*() functions.

- With Jeff Pohlmeyer's help, I fixed the expire timer when using
  curl_multi_socket() during name resolves with c-ares and the LOW_SPEED
  options now work fine with curl_multi_socket() as well.

Daniel (16 October 2006)
- Added a check in configure that simply tries to run a program (not when
  cross-compiling) in order to detect problems with run-time libraries that
  otherwise would occur when the sizeof tests for curl_off_t would run and
  thus be much more confusing to users. The check of course should run after
  all lib-checks are done and before any other test is used that would run an
  executable built for testing-purposes.

Dan F (13 October 2006)
- The tagging of application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST body data sent
  to the CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION callback has been fixed (it was erroneously
  included as part of the header).  A message was also added to the
  command line tool to show when data is being sent, enabled when
  --verbose is used.

Daniel (12 October 2006)
- Starting now, adding an easy handle to a multi stack that was already added
  to a multi stack will cause CURLM_BAD_EASY_HANDLE to get returned.

- Jeff Pohlmeyer has been working with the hiperfifo.c example source code,
  and while doing so it became apparent that the current timeout system for
  the socket API really was a bit awkward since it become quite some work to
  be sure we have the correct timeout set.

  Jeff then provided the new CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION that is yet another
  callback the app can set to get to know when the general timeout time
  changes and thus for an application like hiperfifo.c it makes everything a
  lot easier and nicer. There's a CURLMOPT_TIMERDATA option too of course in
  good old libcurl tradition.

  Jeff has also updated the hiperfifo.c example code to use this news.

Daniel (9 October 2006)
- Bogdan Nicula's second test case (posted Sun, 08 Oct 2006) converted to test
  case 535 and it now runs fine. Again a problem with the pipelining code not
  taking all possible (error) conditions into account.

Daniel (6 October 2006)
- Bogdan Nicula's hanging test case (posted Wed, 04 Oct 2006) was converted to
  test case 533 and the test now runs fine.

Daniel (4 October 2006)
- Dmitriy Sergeyev provided an example source code that crashed CVS libcurl
  but that worked nicely in 7.15.5. I converted it into test case 532 and
  fixed the problem.

Daniel (29 September 2006)
- Removed a few other no-longer present options from the header file.

- Support for FTP third party transfers was removed. Here's why:

  o The recent multi interface changes broke it and the design of the 3rd party
    transfers made it very hard to fix the problems
  o It was still blocking and thus nasty for the multi interface
  o It was a lot of extra code for a very rarely used feature
  o It didn't use the same code as for "plain" FTP transfers, so it didn't work
    fine for IPv6 and it didn't properly re-use connections and more
  o There's nobody around who's willing to work on and improve the existing
    code

  This does not mean that third party transfers are banned forever, only that
  they need to be done better if they are to be re-added in the future.

  The CURLOPT_SOURCE_* options are removed from the lib and so are the --3p*
  options from the command line tool. For this reason, I also bumped the
  version info for the lib.

Daniel (28 September 2006)
- Reported in #1561470 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1561470), libcurl
  would crash if a bad function sequence was used when shutting down after
  using the multi interface (i.e using easy_cleanup after multi_cleanup) so
  precautions have been added to make sure it doesn't any more - test case 529
  was added to verify.

Daniel (27 September 2006)
- The URL in the cookie jar file is now changed since it was giving a 404.
  Reported by Timothy Stone. The new URL will take the visitor to a curl web
  site mirror with the document.

Daniel (24 September 2006)
- Bernard Leak fixed configure --with-gssapi-libs.

- Cory Nelson made libcurl use the WSAPoll() function if built for Windows
  Vista (_WIN32_WINNT >= 0x0600)

Daniel (23 September 2006)
- Mike Protts added --ftp-ssl-control to make curl use FTP-SSL, but only
  encrypt the control connection and use the data connection "plain".

- Dmitriy Sergeyev provided a patch that made the SOCKS[45] code work better
  as it now will read the full data sent from servers. The SOCKS-related code
  was also moved to the new lib/socks.c source file.

Daniel (21 September 2006)
- Added test case 531 in an attempt to repeat bug report #1561470
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1561470) that is said to crash when an
  FTP upload fails with the multi interface. It did not, but I made a failed
  upload still assume the control connection to be fine.

Daniel (20 September 2006)
- Armel Asselin fixed problems when you gave a proxy URL with user name and
  empty password or no password at all. Test case 278 and 279 were added to
  verify.

Daniel (12 September 2006)
- Added docs/examples/10-at-a-time.c by Michael Wallner

- Added docs/examples/hiperfifo.c by Jeff Pohlmeyer

Daniel (11 September 2006)
- Fixed my breakage from earlier today so that doing curl_easy_cleanup() on a
  handle that is part of a multi handle first removes the handle from the
  stack.

- Added CURLOPT_SSL_SESSIONID_CACHE and --no-sessionid to disable SSL
  session-ID re-use on demand since there obviously are broken servers out
  there that misbehave with session-IDs used.

- Jeff Pohlmeyer presented a *multi_socket()-using program that exposed a
  problem with it (SIGSEGV-style). It clearly showed that the existing
  socket-state and state-difference function wasn't good enough so I rewrote
  it and could then re-run Jeff's program without any crash. The previous
  version clearly could miss to tell the application when a handle changed
  from using one socket to using another.

  While I was at it (as I could use this as a means to track this problem
  down), I've now added a 'magic' number to the easy handle struct that is
  inited at curl_easy_init() time and cleared at curl_easy_cleanup() time that
  we can use internally to detect that an easy handle seems to be fine, or at
  least not closed or freed (freeing in debug builds fill the area with 0x13
  bytes but in normal builds we can of course not assume any particular data
  in the freed areas).

Daniel (9 September 2006)
- Michele Bini fixed how the hostname is put in NTLM packages. As servers
  don't expect fully qualified names we need to cut them off at the first dot.

- Peter Sylvester cleaned up and fixed the getsockname() uses in ftp.c. Some
  of them can be completetly removed though...

Daniel (6 September 2006)
- Ravi Pratap and I have implemented HTTP Pipelining support. Enable it for a
  multi handle using CURLMOPT_PIPELINING and all HTTP connections done on that
  handle will be attempted to get pipelined instead of done in parallell as
  they are performed otherwise.

  As a side-effect from this work, connections are now shared between all easy
  handles within a multi handle, so if you use N easy handles for transfers,
  each of them can pick up and re-use a connection that was previously used by
  any of the handles, be it the same or one of the others.

  This separation of the tight relationship between connections and easy
  handles is most noticable when you close easy handles that have been used in
  a multi handle and check amount of used memory or watch the debug output, as
  there are times when libcurl will keep the easy handle around for a while
  longer to be able to close it properly. Like for sending QUIT to close down
  an FTP connection.

  This is a major change.
  
Daniel (4 September 2006)
- Dmitry Rechkin (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1551412) provided a
  patch that while not fixing things very nicely, it does make the SOCKS5
  proxy connection slightly better as it now acknowledges the timeout for
  connection and it no longer segfaults in the case when SOCKS requires
  authentication and you did not specify username:password.

Daniel (31 August 2006)
- Dmitriy Sergeyev found and fixed a multi interface flaw when using asynch
  name resolves. It could get stuck in the wrong state.

Gisle (29 August 2006)
- Added support for other MS-DOS compilers (desides djgpp). All MS-DOS
  compiler now uses the same config.dos file (renamed to config.h by
  make). libcurl now builds fine using Watcom and Metaware's High-C
  using the Watt-32 tcp/ip-stack.

Daniel (29 August 2006)
- David McCreedy added CURLOPT_SOCKOPTFUNCTION and CURLOPT_SOCKOPTDATA to
  allow applications to set their own socket options.

Daniel (25 August 2006)
- Armel Asselin reported that the 'running_handles' counter wasn't updated
  properly if you removed a "live" handle from a multi handle with
  curl_multi_remove_handle().

Daniel (22 August 2006)
- David McCreedy fixed a remaining mistake from the August 19 TYPE change.

- Peter Sylvester pointed out a flaw in the AllowServerConnect() in the FTP
  code when doing pure ipv6 EPRT connections.

Daniel (19 August 2006)
- Based on a patch by Armel Asselin, the FTP code no longer re-issues the TYPE
  command on subsequent requests on a re-used connection unless it has to.

- Armel Asselin fixed a crash in the FTP code when using SINGLECWD mode and
  files in the root directory.

- Andrew Biggs pointed out a "Expect: 100-continue" flaw where libcurl didn't
  send the whole request at once, even though the Expect: header was disabled
  by the application. An effect of this change is also that small (< 1024
  bytes) POSTs are now always sent without Expect: header since we deem it
  more costly to bother about that than the risk that we send the data in
  vain.

Daniel (9 August 2006)
- Armel Asselin made the CURLOPT_PREQUOTE option work fine even when
  CURLOPT_NOBODY is set true. PREQUOTE is then run roughly at the same place
  in the command sequence as it would have run if there would've been a
  transfer.

Daniel (8 August 2006)
- Fixed a flaw in the "Expect: 100-continue" treatment. If you did two POSTs
  on a persistent connection and allowed the first to use that header, you
  could not disable it for the second request.

Daniel (7 August 2006)
- Domenico Andreolfound a quick build error which happened because
  src/config.h.in was not a proper duplcate of lib/config.h.in which it
  should've been and this was due to the maketgz script not doing the cp
  properly.

Version 7.15.5 (7 August 2006)

Daniel (2 August 2006)
- Mark Lentczner fixed how libcurl was not properly doing chunked encoding
  if the header "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" was set by the application.
  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1531838

Daniel (1 August 2006)
- Maciej Karpiuk fixed a crash that would occur if we passed Curl_strerror()
  an unknown error number on glibc systems.
  http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1532289

Daniel (31 July 2006)
- *ALERT* curl_multi_socket() and curl_multi_socket_all() got modified
  prototypes: they both now provide the number of running handles back to the
  calling function. It makes the functions resemble the good old
  curl_multi_perform() more and provides a nice way to know when the multi
  handle goes empty.

  ALERT2: don't use the curl_multi_socket*() functionality in anything
  production-like until I say it's somewhat settled, as I suspect there might
  be some further API changes before I'm done...

Daniel (28 July 2006)
- Yves Lejeune fixed so that replacing Content-Type: when doing multipart
  formposts work exactly the way you want it (and the way you'd assume it
  works).

Daniel (27 July 2006)
- David McCreedy added --ftp-ssl-reqd which makes curl *require* SSL for both
  control and data connection, as the existing --ftp-ssl option only requests
  it.

- [Hiper-related work] Added a function called curl_multi_assign() that will
  set a private pointer added to the internal libcurl hash table for the
  particular socket passed in to this function:

  CURLMcode curl_multi_assign(CURLM *multi_handle,
                              curl_socket_t sockfd,
                              void *sockp);

  'sockp' being a custom pointer set by the application to be associated with
  this socket. The socket has to be already existing and in-use by libcurl,
  like having already called the callback telling about its existance.

  The set hashp pointer will then be passed on to the callback in upcoming
  calls when this same socket is used (in the brand new 'socketp' argument).

Daniel (26 July 2006)
- Dan Nelson added the CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER libcurl option and curl
  tool option named --ftp-alternative-to-user. It provides a mean to send a
  particular command if the normal USER/PASS approach fails.

- Michael Jerris added magic that builds lib/curllib.vcproj automatically for
  newer MSVC.

Daniel (25 July 2006)
- Georg Horn made the transfer timeout error message include more details.

Daniel (20 July 2006)
- David McCreedy fixed a build error when building libcurl with HTTP disabled,
  problem added with the curl_formget() patch.

Daniel (17 July 2006)
- Jari Sundell did some excellent research and bug tracking, figured out that
  we did wrong and patched it: When nodes were removed from the splay tree,
  and we didn't properly remove it from the splay tree when an easy handle was
  removed from a multi stack and thus we could wrongly leave a node in the
  splay tree pointing to (bad) memory.

Daniel (14 July 2006)
- David McCreedy fixed a flaw where the CRLF counter wasn't properly cleared
  for FTP ASCII transfers.

Daniel (8 July 2006)
- Ates Goral pointed out that libcurl's cookie parser did case insensitive
  string comparisons on the path which is incorrect and provided a patch that
  fixes this. I edited test case 8 to include details that test for this.

- Ingmar Runge provided a source snippet that caused a crash. The reason for
  the crash was that libcurl internally was a bit confused about who owned the
  DNS cache at all times so if you created an easy handle that uses a shared
  DNS cache and added that to a multi handle it would crash. Now we keep more
  careful internal track of exactly what kind of DNS cache each easy handle
  uses: None, Private (allocated for and used only by this single handle),
  Shared (points to a cache held by a shared object), Global (points to the
  global cache) or Multi (points to the cache within the multi handle that is
  automatically shared between all easy handles that are added with private
  caches).

Daniel (4 July 2006)
- Toshiyuki Maezawa fixed a problem where you couldn't override the
  Proxy-Connection: header when using a proxy and not doing CONNECT.

Daniel (24 June 2006)
- Michael Wallner added curl_formget(), which allows an application to extract
  (serialise) a previously built formpost (as with curl_formadd()).

Daniel (23 June 2006)
- Arve Knudsen found a flaw in curl_multi_fdset() for systems where
  curl_socket_t is unsigned (like Windows) that could cause it to wrongly
  return a max fd of -1.

Daniel (20 June 2006)
- Peter Silva introduced CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and
  CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE that limit tha maximum rate libcurl is allowed
  to send or receive data. This kind of adds the the command line tool's
  option --limit-rate to the library.

  The rate limiting logic in the curl app is now removed and is instead
  provided by libcurl itself. Transfer rate limiting will now also work for -d
  and -F, which it didn't before.

Daniel (19 June 2006)
- Made -K on a file that couldn't be read cause a warning to be displayed.

Daniel (13 June 2006)
- Dan Fandrich implemented --enable-hidden-symbols configure option to enable
  -fvisibility=hidden on gcc >= 4.0.  This reduces the size of the libcurl
  binary and speeds up dynamic linking by hiding all the internal symbols from
  the symbol table.

Version 7.15.4 (12 June 2006)

Daniel (8 June 2006)
- Brian Dessent fixed the code for cygwin in three distinct ways:

  The first modifies {lib,src}/setup.h to not include the winsock headers
  under Cygwin.  This fixes the reported build problem.  Cygwin attempts as
  much as possible to emulate a posix environment under Windows.  This means
  that WIN32 is *not* #defined and (to the extent possible) everything is done
  as it would be on a *ix type system.  Thus <sys/socket.h> is the proper
  include, and even though winsock2.h is present, including it just introduces
  a whole bunch of incompatible socket API stuff.

  The second is a patch I've included in the Cygwin binary packages for a
  while.  It skips two unnecessary library checks (-lwinmm and -lgdi32).  The
  checks are innocuous and they do succeed, but they pollute LIBS with
  unnecessary stuff which gets recorded as such in the libcurl.la file, which
  brings them into the build of any libcurl-downstream.  As far as I know
  these libs are really only necessary for mingw, so alternatively they could
  be designed to only run if $host matches *-*-mingw* but I took the safer
  route of skipping them for *-*-cygwin*.

  The third patch replaces all uses of the ancient and obsolete __CYGWIN32__
  with __CYGWIN__. Ref: <http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-09/msg01520.html>.

Daniel (7 June 2006)
- Mikael Sennerholm provided a patch that added NTLM2 session response support
  to libcurl. The 21 NTLM test cases were again modified to comply...

Daniel (27 May 2006)
- Óscar Morales Vivó updated the libcurl.framework.make file.

Daniel (26 May 2006)
- Olaf Stüben fixed a bug that caused Digest authentication with md5-sess to
  fail. When using the md5-sess, the result was not Md5 encoded and Base64
  transformed.

Daniel (25 May 2006)
- Michael Wallner provided a patch that allows "SESS" to be set with
  CURLOPT_COOKIELIST, which then makes all session cookies get cleared.

Daniel (24 May 2006)
- Tor Arntsen made test 271 run fine again since the TFTP path fix.

Daniel (23 May 2006)
- Martin Michlmayr filed debian bug report #367954, but the same error also
  showed up in the autobuilds. It seems a rather long-since introduced shell
  script flaw in the configure script suddenly was detected by the bash
  version in Debian Unstable. It had previously passed undetected by all
  shells used so far...

- David McCreedy updated lib/config-tpf.h

Daniel (11 May 2006)
- Fixed the configure's check for old-style SSLeay headers since I fell over a
  case with a duplicate file name (a krb4 implementation with an err.h
  file). I converted the check to manually make sure three of the headers are
  present before considering them fine.

- David McCreedy provided a fix for CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET that does extended
  checks on the to-be-returned socket to make sure it truly seems to be alive
  and well. For SSL connection it (only) uses OpenSSL functions.

Daniel (10 May 2006)
- Fixed DICT in two aspects:

  1 - allow properly URL-escaped words, like using %20 for spaces

  2 - properly escape certain letters within a word to comply to the RFC2229

Daniel (9 May 2006)
- Andreas Ntaflos reported a bug in libcurl.m4: When configuring my GNU
  autotools project, which optionally (default=yes) uses libcurl on a system
  without a (usable) libcurl installation, but not specifying
  `--without-libcurl', configure determines correctly that no libcurl is
  available, however, the LIBCURL variable gets expanded to `LIBCURL = -lcurl'
  in the resulting Makefiles.

  David Shaw fixed the flaw.

- Robson Braga Araujo fixed two problems in the recently added non-blocking SSL
  connects. The state machine was not reset properly so that subsequent
  connects using the same handle would fail, and there were two memory leaks.

- Robson Braga Araujo fixed a memory leak when you added an easy handle to a
  multi stack and that easy handle had already been used to do one or more
  easy interface transfers, as then the code threw away the previously used
  DNS cache without properly freeing it.

Daniel (8 May 2006)
- Dan Fandrich went over the TFTP code and he pointed out and fixed numerous
  problems:

  * The received file is corrupted when a packet is lost and retransmitted
    (this is a serious problem!)

  * Transmitting a file aborts if a block is lost and retransmitted

  * Data is stored in the wrong location in the buffer for uploads, so uploads
    always fail (I don't see how it could have ever worked, but it did on x86
    at least)

  * A number of calls are made to strerror instead of Curl_strerror, making
    the code not thread safe

  * There are references to errno instead of Curl_sockerrno(), causing
    incorrect error messages on Windows

  * The file name includes a leading / which violates RFC3617. Doing something
    similar to ftp, where two slashes after the host name means an absolute
    reference seems a reasonable extension to fix this.

  * Failures in EBCDIC conversion are not propagated up to the caller but are
    silently ignored

- Fixed known bug #28. The TFTP code no longer assumes a packed struct and
  thus works reliably on more platforms.

Daniel (5 May 2006)
- Roland Blom filed bug report #1481217
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1481217), with follow-ups by Michele
  Bini and David Byron. libcurl previously wrongly used GetLastError() on
  windows to get error details after socket-related function calls, when it
  really should use WSAGetLastError() instead.

  When changing to this, the former function Curl_ourerrno() is now instead
  called Curl_sockerrno() as it is necessary to only use it to get errno from
  socket-related functions as otherwise it won't work as intended on Windows.

Daniel (4 May 2006)
- Mark Eichin submitted bug report #1480821
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1480821) He found and identified a
  problem with how libcurl dealt with GnuTLS and a case where gnutls returned
  GNUTLS_E_AGAIN indicating it would block. It would then return an unexpected
  return code, making Curl_ssl_send() confuse the upper layer - causing random
  28 bytes trash data to get inserted in the transfered stream.

  The proper fix was to make the Curl_gtls_send() function return the proper
  return codes that the callers would expect. The Curl_ossl_send() function
  already did this.

Daniel (2 May 2006)
- Added a --checkfor option to curl-config to allow users to easier
  write for example shell scripts that test for the presence of a
  new-enough libcurl version. If --checkfor is given a version string
  newer than what is currently installed, curl-config will return a
  non-zero exit code and output a string about the unfulfilled
  requirement.

Daniel (26 April 2006)
- David McCreedy brought initial line end conversions when doing FTP ASCII
  transfers. They are done on non-windows systems and translate CRLF to LF.

  I modified the 15 LIST-using test cases accordingly. The downside is that now
  we'll have even more trouble to get the tests to run on Windows since they
  should get CRLF newlines left intact which the *nix versions don't. I figure
  the only sane thing to do is to add some kind of [newline] macro for the test
  case files and have them expanded to the proper native line ending when the
  test cases are run. This is however left to implement.

Daniel (25 April 2006)
- Paul Querna fixed libcurl to better deal with deflate content encoding
  when the stream (wrongly) lacks a proper zlib header. This seems to be the
  case on too many actual server implementations.

Daniel (21 April 2006)
- Ale Vesely fixed CURLOPT_INTERFACE when using a hostname.

Daniel (19 April 2006)
- Based on previous info from Tor Arntsen, I made configure detect the Intel
  ICC compiler to add a compiler option for it, in order for configure to
  properly be able to detect function prototypes.

- Robson Braga Araujo provided a patch that makes libcurl less eager to close
  the control connection when using FTP, for example when you remove an easy
  handle from a multi stack.

- Applied a patch by Ates Goral and Katie Wang that corrected my bad fix
  attempt from April 10.

Daniel (11 April 2006)
- #1468330 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1468330) pointed out a bad
  typecast in the curl tool leading to a crash with (64bit?) VS2005 (at least)
  since the struct timeval field tv_sec is an int while time_t is 64bit.

Daniel (10 April 2006)
- Ates Goral found out that if you specified both CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT and
  CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, the _longer_ time would wrongly be used for the SSL
  connection time-out!

- I merged my hiper patch (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/hiper/) into the main
  sources. See the lib/README.multi_socket for implementation story with
  details. Don't expect it to work fully yet. I don't intend to blow any
  whistles or ring any bells about it until I'm more convinced it works at
  least somewhat reliably.

Daniel (7 April 2006)
- David McCreedy's EBCDIC and TPF changes. Three new curl_easy_setopt()
  options (callbacks) were added:

  CONV_FROM_NETWORK_FUNCTION
  CONV_TO_NETWORK_FUNCTION
  CONV_FROM_UTF8_FUNCTION

Daniel (5 April 2006)
- Michele Bini modified the NTLM code to work for his "weird IIS case"
  (http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2006-02/0154.html) by adding the NTLM hash
  function in addition to the LM one and making some other adjustments in the
  order the different parts of the data block are sent in the Type-2 reply.
  Inspiration for this work was taken from the Firefox NTLM implementation.

  I edited the existing 21(!) NTLM test cases to run fine with these news. Due
  to the fact that we now properly include the host name in the Type-2 message
  the test cases now only compare parts of that chunk.

Daniel (28 March 2006)
- #1451929 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1451929) detailed a bug that
  occurred when asking libcurl to follow HTTP redirects and the original URL
  had more than one question mark (?). Added test case 276 to verify.

Daniel (27 March 2006)
- David Byron found a problem multiple -d options when libcurl was built with
  --enable-debug, as then curl used free() on memory allocated both with
  normal malloc() and with libcurl-provided functions, when the latter MUST be
  freed with curl_free() in debug builds.

Daniel (26 March 2006)
- Tor Arntsen figured out that TFTP was broken on a lot of systems since we
  called bind() with a too big argument in the 3rd parameter and at least
  Tru64, AIX and IRIX seem to be very picky about it.

Daniel (21 March 2006)
- David McCreedy added CURLINFO_FTP_ENTRY_PATH.

- Xavier Bouchoux made the SSL connection non-blocking for the multi interface
  (when using OpenSSL).

- Tor Arntsen fixed the AIX Toolbox RPM spec

Daniel (20 March 2006)
- David McCreedy fixed libcurl to no longer ignore AUTH failures and now it
  reacts properly according to the CURLOPT_FTP_SSL setting.

- Dan Fandrich fixed two TFTP problems: Fixed a bug whereby a received file
  whose length was a multiple of 512 bytes could have random garbage
  appended. Also, stop processing TFTP packets which are too short to be
  legal.

- Ilja van Sprundel reported a possible crash in the curl tool when using
  "curl hostwithoutslash -d data -G"

Version 7.15.3 (20 March 2006)

Daniel (20 March 2006)
- VULNERABILITY reported to us by Ulf Harnhammar.

  libcurl uses the given file part of a TFTP URL in a manner that allows a
  malicious user to overflow a heap-based memory buffer due to the lack of
  boundary check.

  This overflow happens if you pass in a URL with a TFTP protocol prefix
  ("tftp://"), using a valid host and a path part that is longer than 512
  bytes.

  The affected flaw can be triggered by a redirect, if curl/libcurl is told to
  follow redirects and an HTTP server points the client to a tftp URL with the
  characteristics described above.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2006-1061 to this issue.

Daniel (16 March 2006)
- Tor Arntsen provided a RPM spec file for AIX Toolbox, that now is included
  in the release archive.

Daniel (14 March 2006)
- David McCreedy fixed:

  a bad SSL error message when OpenSSL certificates are verified fine.

  a missing return code assignment in the FTP code

Daniel (7 March 2006)
- Markus Koetter filed debian bug report #355715 which identified a problem
  with the multi interface and multi-part formposts. The fix from February
  22nd could make the Curl_done() function get called twice on the same
  connection and it was not designed for that and thus tried to call free() on
  an already freed memory area!

- Peter Heuchert made sure the CURLFTPSSL_CONTROL setting for CURLOPT_FTP_SSL
  is used properly.

Daniel (6 March 2006)
- Lots of users on Windows have reported getting the "SSL: couldn't set
  callback" error message so I've now made the setting of that callback not be
  as critical as before. The function is only used for additional loggging/
  trace anyway so a failure just means slightly less data. It should still be
  able to proceed and connect fine to the server.

Daniel (4 March 2006)
- Thomas Klausner provided a patch written by Todd Vierling in bug report
  #1442471 that fixes a build problem on Interix.

Daniel (2 March 2006)
- FTP upload without a file name part in the URL now causes
  curl_easy_perform() to return CURLE_URL_MALFORMAT. Previously it allowed the
  upload but named the file "(nil)" (without the quotes). Test case 524
  verifies.

- Added a check for getprotobyname in configure so that it'll be used, thanks
  to Gisle Vanem's change the other day.

Daniel (28 February 2006)
- Dan Fandrich prevented curl from getting stuck in an endless loop in case we
  are out of file handles very early in curl's code where it makes sure that
  0, 1 and 2 aren't gonna be used by the lib for transfers.

Daniel (27 February 2006)
- Marty Kuhrt pointed out that there were two VMS-specific files missing in
  the release archive.

Version 7.15.2 (27 February 2006)

Daniel (22 February 2006)
- Lots of work and analysis by "xbx___" in bug #1431750
  (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1431750) helped me identify and fix two
  different but related bugs:

  1) Removing an easy handle from a multi handle before the transfer is done
     could leave a connection in the connection cache for that handle that is
     in a state that isn't suitable for re-use. A subsequent re-use could then
     read from a NULL pointer and segfault.

  2) When an easy handle was removed from the multi handle, there could be an
     outstanding c-ares DNS name resolve request. When the response arrived,
     it caused havoc since the connection struct it "belonged" to could've
     been freed already.

  Now Curl_done() is called when an easy handle is removed from a multi handle
  pre-maturely (that is, before the transfer was complteted). Curl_done() also
  makes sure to cancel all (if any) outstanding c-ares requests.

Daniel (21 February 2006)
- Peter Su added support for SOCKS4 proxies. Enable this by setting the proxy
  type to the already provided type CURLPROXY_SOCKS4.

  I added a --socks4 option that works like the current --socks5 option but
  instead use the socks4 protocol.

Daniel (20 February 2006)
- Shmulik Regev fixed an issue with multi-pass authentication and compressed
  content when libcurl didn't honor the internal ignorebody flag.

Daniel (18 February 2006)
- Ulf Härnhammar fixed a format string (printf style) problem in the Negotiate
  code. It should however not be the cause of any troubles. He also fixed a
  few similar problems in the HTTP test server code.

Daniel (17 February 2006)
- Shmulik Regev provided a fix for the DNS cache when using short life times,
  as previously it could be holding on to old cached entries longer than
  requested.

Daniel (11 February 2006)
- Karl Moerder added the CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY and CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET options
  that an app can use to let libcurl only connect to a remote host and then
  extract the socket from libcurl. libcurl will then not attempt to do any
  transfer at all after the connect is done.

- Kent Boortz improved the configure check for GnuTLS to properly set LIBS
  instead of LDFLAGS.

Daniel (8 February 2006)
- Philippe Vaucher provided a brilliant piece of test code that show a problem
  with re-used FTP connections. If the second request on the same connection
  was set not to fetch a "body", libcurl could get confused and consider it an
  attempt to use a dead connection and would go acting mighty strange.

Daniel (2 February 2006)
- Make --limit-rate [num] mean bytes. It used to be that but it broke in my
  change done in November 2005.

Daniel (30 January 2006)
- Added CURLOPT_LOCALPORT and CURLOPT_LOCALPORTRANGE to libcurl. Set with the
  curl tool with --local-port. Plain and simply set the range of ports to bind
  the local end of connections to. Implemented on to popular demand.

- Based on an error report by Philippe Vaucher, we no longer count a retried
  connection setup as a follow-redirect. It turns out 1) this fails when a FTP
  connection is re-setup and 2) it does make the max-redirs counter behave
  wrong.

Daniel (24 January 2006)
- Michal Marek provided a patch for FTP that makes libcurl continue to try
  PASV even after EPSV returned a positive response code, if libcurl failed to
  connect to the port number the EPSV response said. Obviously some people are
  going through protocol-sensitive firewalls (or similar) that don't
  understand EPSV and then they don't allow the second connection unless PASV
  was used. This also called for a minor fix of test case 238.

Daniel (20 January 2006)
- Duane Cathey was one of our friends who reported that curl -P [IP]
  (CURLOPT_FTPPORT) didn't work for ipv6-enabed curls if the IP wasn't a
  "native" IP while it works fine for ipv6-disabled builds!

  In the process of fixing this, I removed the support for LPRT since I can't
  think of many reasons to keep doing it and asking on the mailing list didn't
  reveal anyone else that could either. The code that sends EPRT and PORT is
  now also a lot simpler than before (IMHO).

Daniel (19 January 2006)
- Jon Turner pointed out that doing -P [hostname] (CURLOPT_FTPPORT) with curl
  (built ipv4-only) didn't work.

Daniel (18 January 2006)
- As reported in bug #1408742 (http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=1408742),
  the configure script complained about a missing "missing" script if you ran
  configure within a path whose name included one or more spaces. This is due
  to a flaw in automake (1.9.6 and earlier). I've now worked around it by
  including an "overloaded" version of the AM_MISSING_HAS_RUN script that'll
  be used instead of the one automake ships with. This kludge needs to be
  removed once we get an automake version with this problem corrected.
  Possibly we'll then need to convert this into a kludge depending on what
  automake version that is used and that is gonna be painful and I don't even
  want to think about that now...!

Daniel (17 January 2006)
- David Shaw: Here is the latest libcurl.m4 autoconf tests. It is updated with
  the latest features and protocols that libcurl supports and has a minor fix
  to better deal with the obscure case where someone has more than one libcurl
  installed at the same time.

Daniel (16 January 2006)
- David Shaw finally removed all traces of Gopher and we are now officially
  not supporting it. It hasn't been functioning for years anyway, so this is
  just finally stating what already was true. And a cleanup at the same time.

- Bryan Henderson turned the 'initialized' variable for curl_global_init()
  into a counter, and thus you can now do multiple curl_global_init() and you
  are then supposed to do the same amount of calls to curl_global_cleanup().
  Bryan has also updated the docs accordingly.

Daniel (13 January 2006)
- Andrew Benham fixed a race condition in the test suite that could cause the
  test script to kill all processes in the current process group!

Daniel (12 January 2006)
- Michael Jahn:

  Fixed FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP and FTP_USE_EPSV to "do right" when used on FTP thru
  HTTP proxy.

  Fixed PROXYTUNNEL to work fine when you do ftp through a proxy.  It would
  previously overwrite internal memory and cause unpredicted behaviour!

Daniel (11 January 2006)
- I decided to document the "secret option" here now, as I've received *NO*
  feedback at all on my mailing list requests from November 2005:

  I'm looking for feedback and comments. I added some experimental code the
  other day, that allows a libcurl user to select what method libcurl should
  use to reach a file on a FTP(S) server.

  This functionality is available in CVS code and in recent daily snapshots.

  Let me explain...

  The current name for the option is CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD (--ftp-method for
  the command line tool) and you set it to a long (there are currenly no
  defines for the argument values, just plain numericals). You can set three
  different "methods" that do this:

  1 multicwd - like today, curl will do a single CWD operation for each path
           part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means very many
           commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should be done. This is the
           default.

  2 nocwd - no CWD at all is done, curl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR etc and give
           a full path to the server.

  3 singlecwd - make one CWD with the full target directory and then operate
            on the file "normally".

  (With the command line tool you do --ftp-method [METHOD], where [METHOD] is
  one of "multicwd", "nocwd" or "singlecwd".)

  What feedback I'm interested in:

  1 - Do they work at all? Do you find servers where one of these don't work?

  2 - What would proper names for the option and its arguments be, if we
      consider this feature good enough to get included and documented in
      upcoming releases?

  3 - Should we make libcurl able to "walk through" these options in case of
      (path related) failures, or should it fail and let the user redo any
      possible retries?

  (This option is not documented in any man page just yet since I'm not sure
  these names will be used or if the functionality will end up exactly like
  this.  And for the same reasons we have no test cases for these yet.)

Daniel (10 January 2006)
- When using a bad path over FTP, as in when libcurl couldn't CWD into all
  given subdirs, libcurl would still "remember" the full path as if it is the
  current directory libcurl is in so that the next curl_easy_perform() would
  get really confused if it tried the same path again - as it would not issue
  any CWD commands at all, assuming it is already in the "proper" dir.

  Starting now, a failed CWD command sets a flag that prevents the path to be
  "remembered" after returning.

Daniel (7 January 2006)
- Michael Jahn fixed so that the second CONNECT when doing FTP over a HTTP
  proxy actually used a new connection and not sent the second request on the
  first socket!

Daniel (6 January 2006)
- Alexander Lazic made the buildconf run the buildconf in the ares dir if that
  is present instead of trying to mimic that script in curl's buildconf
  script.

Daniel (3 January 2006)
- Andres Garcia made the TFTP test server build with mingw.
