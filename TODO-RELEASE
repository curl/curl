======================

6. REST fix for servers not behaving well on >2GB requests. This should fail
   if the server doesn't set the pointer to the requested index. The tricky
   part is to figure out if the server did the right thing or not.

10. Anton Fedorov's "dumpcert" patch UNASSIGNED

14. Evaluate/apply Gertjan van Wingerde's SSL patches, UNASSIGNED

23. Peter Sylvester's "Most Significant Common Name" change. Feedback welcome.
    At least the UTF8 conversion and comparison should be done. Patch?
    UNASSIGNED

24. Make the progress meter use one digit more for the hour time fields.
    Accomplish this by removing one of the times displayed.

28. Optimize the way libcurl uses CWD on each new request over a persistent
    connection (on FTP) even if it doesn't have to.

30. Digest re-negotiation is not supported, we wrongly assume a new 401
    response to signify an authenticaion error. We need to detect the
    difference between a 401 due to a bad Digest authorization header and a
    401 because the server wants to re-negotiate.
