Include files for libcurl, external users.

They're all placed in the curl subdirectory here for better fit in any kind
of environment. You should include files from here using...

        #include <curl/curl.h>

... style and point the compiler's include path to the directory holding the
curl subdirectory. It makes it more likely to survive future modifications.
