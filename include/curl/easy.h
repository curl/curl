 * NAME curl_easy_getinfo()
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Request internal information from the curl session with this function.  The
 * third argument MUST be a pointer to a long, a pointer to a char * or a
 * pointer to a double (as the documentation describes elsewhere).  The data
 * pointed to will be filled in accordingly and can be relied upon only if the
 * function returns CURLE_OK.  This function is intended to get used *AFTER* a
 * performed transfer, all results from this function are undefined until the
 * transfer is completed.

/*
 * NAME curl_easy_duphandle()
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Creates a new curl session handle with the same options set for the handle
 * passed in. Duplicating a handle could only be a matter of cloning data and
 * options, internal state info and things like persistant connections cannot
 * be transfered. It is useful in multithreaded applications when you can run
 * curl_easy_duphandle() for each new thread to avoid a series of identical
 * curl_easy_setopt() invokes in every thread.
